you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days during this part-session
why are there no fire instructions
two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure
in addition the need for greater transparency has been pointed out
this would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously
we observe that there is always a possibility of major problems of this kind occurring where nature gives rise to troublesome phenomena such as mist storms or cold weather particularly in the narrow alpine passes
these are two areas of action which i invite the commissioner to set up and in which i would ask him to involve us
mr fruteau we at least need to recognize that there is growth and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession as has been the case in the past
apart from that i could refer to any customers any sector as customers and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields
the advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within european business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions
i do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the commission but on the contrary fundamental contributions since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome
the reform will lead to a gradual development - i stress this because i was particularly taken with this term used by mrs randzio-plath and moreover i fully agree with it - of european competition culture
the fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned permitting greater use of community law which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply
the existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the director of the agency
further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called five wise men
when it comes to the demands made on the intergovernmental conference agenda it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take center stage
i do not believe so
mr president the eu is now exposed to tough scrutiny
this is why i should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries
many volunteers from france and other european countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field
it is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility irresponsible charterers untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies
it is up to the members states and the community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this
they have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens
however having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees i recognize that this was not feasible
question no 29 by h-0786 99
when will the commission appoint a special envoy for tibet
the appointment of an eu special envoy for tibet would be primarily a matter for the council to decide and parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them
we are contributing to programs in the region which have some ecological impact
however for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance freedom of movement is still highly restricted
the commission wants openness and believes that it should only refuse your chamber access to information where there is a need to preserve interests meriting protection
is this possible
and i would also say this to you commissioner please deliver the beef even if it is british
naturally i will not take up any more of the time of the house than is absolutely necessary
a series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months
alternatively it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions in order to move forward in another way
instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund we could take the decision to set this up
ladies and gentlemen these questions go to the very heart of the concerns underlying the portuguese presidency 's program and the concerns of our government which is behind this program
in order to remove these causes one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question
i am sure that your answer to this will be yes but i would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be
it could do this in the same thorough way in which it has worked on the proposals we are already familiar with
in other words once this study is complete the commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible
if peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable non-fossil energy source it must form its own class especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned
why do i say that culture is important
we want a europe based on the principle of diversity within unity
there are certain weaknesses the greatest of which in my opinion is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses after all the car industry is more than just large companies
this will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading
however i cannot accept that an eu body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one member state
the political leaders of europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another member state just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority
agenda
the means of achieving this are difficult but they are real
on south-eastern europe i agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements
one final remark regarding the internet and globalisation
on the other hand we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down
europe 's salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of europe
i counted no less than seven calls in the resolution at different points for equal rights for european citizens and legal immigrants
finally there is currently still no european urban policy within the european union
i too therefore can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments
the disease is always fatal
regardless of the many other concerns we may have bse has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved
this convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and not least to our descendants
we can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards
you realize that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned
i also rely not only on the cooperation of the members of the european parliament but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organizations which have always made an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the commission
- additionality is a major issue too in wales which i represent
river waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought
its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action which during the directive 's first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalized to the benefit of big business
without protection under intellectual property law creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed
does it in fact want to privatise education
i would like to add that the flight from amsterdam 's schipol airport was also delayed and then canceled
this also applies to the sphere of trade where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other community policies and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the member states
as far as i could hear - but i may have missed something - the president-in-office of the council did not mention the word trade at all
there are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest
parliament 's resolution on the wto negotiations advocated a free import policy by the eu
it is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult
the council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years but the commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years
here in the european parliament some of the members do not want the charter of rights which is being discussed at the moment to become enforceable in law
for ten years now the elected president of that country has been under house arrest
the idea that heading 7 could be added to in this way and heading 4 left alone is not workable
but where will you place the emphasis
with regard to resolution 1244 if it is a trap then i do not understand either why it is that you think that every violation of this trap is considered to be damaging
furthermore we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposals that we have on this issue
both parties were once part of the government
but no such thing happened and it is satisfying to note that these same words now no longer sound provocative at all
mr president commissioner the war in kosovo has knocked everything off balance
in fact we are aware that these are already happening widely
successful application of this agreement by the member states requires unanimity within the council
this makes it possible for companies to relocate even within the european union from one country to another where directives are less strictly applied companies have greater benefits and workers are less well protected
we do not the extent to which far-right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame
i assume therefore that the eu will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance
only a few days later we are able to add another terrible environmental disaster to the list
.
i have been personally involved in tourism competence discussions for europe since the beginning of the 90s
in addition employment policy in general is also a factor
as such the tourism sector offers employment policy a ray of hope
should we complain about this delay
.
the adoption of the white paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and i hope that it will remain closed forever
mr prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities
we have not heard any information from mr solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to russia and chechnya
but access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates
that is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination whether it is in favor of women or supposed social minorities
a third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of commissioner nielson
i will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which i regard as the essential issue in today 's debate
we basically highlighted the possibility of encountering difficulties in terms of growth in the usa and therefore in other parts of the world and of a sudden rise in inflation
in particular we should after thinking one or two things through head in the direction of multiannual quota setting
this lead has since been followed by a number of parties and it cannot be said that the electorate have risen in protest to condemn such parties for their actions
mr president we voted in favor of the resolution on the wreck of the erika out of solidarity with the victims of this ecological disaster
this will put us back in the lead and this is why we adopted the e-europe initiative which prompted the commission to set a practical example in its administrative reform
i am confident that in lisbon we will be able to take a step forwards pooling benchmarking experiments and proposals on this major issue
mr president we place our trust in you
it is simply unacceptable for shareholders or directors of plcs to be the only ones who decide on jobs the economy and share prices
thank you very much for this generous gift to my colleagues
the areas in question are environmental policy consumer protection and health policy
mr president ladies and gentlemen i feel that this is an approach which is in line with what we voted on two years ago
mr president in many ways i think that we are about to end up with a good compromise on the directive relating to cocoa and chocolate products thanks especially to mr paul lannoye 's efforts
i want to warn against joining the council of europe 's convention especially if this step were not to be combined with a binding charter
the charter must therefore ensure that it defines the limits of the content of files the means permitted for data retrieval and access methods
i think it is very relevant that the present socialist united kingdom government is committed to ensuring that the charter is non-justiciable and does not extend beyond existing rights to those not currently contained in the treaties
professor we shall have further opportunities to state this and to try to convince the other negotiators of this throughout the coming months
mr president i wanted earlier on as i concluded my previous speech to make a point of order to which i should like to alert the president and the bureau
the second concerns for example the work program for environmental strategy
they have had more than 12 hours in which to correct the amendments concerned
in fact they are closed down if it appears that it is cheaper to co-incinerate waste in the cement industry and in electricity plants
however to begin let me say the following the ffh directive is an important directive and creates a new climate in europe for the protection of nature the environment and birds
in creating international tribunals like those now dealing with the former yugoslavia and rwanda we have taken a step forward in making life more difficult for people who encourage acts which infringe the values of the geneva conventions
the coalition has undertaken to table this before the nationalrat national assembly by january two thousand ninety eight and the highly criticised government is continuing to burnish austria 's already excellent image in the field of human rights
however i still believe that this is an essential condition to ensure respect for the 5 rule
pt we fundamentally reject the principle of allowing chocolate to be produced throughout the member states using a percentage of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter
the directive before us today is part of this strategy as it aims to regulate the thermal treatment of hazardous or non-hazardous waste
fraternity gives meaning to solidarity rejects exclusion and solitude and ensures respect for differences
this essentially represents what we might call the ethical pillar of the union
this was also the case in yesterday 's debate on the duff and voggenhuber report and it is also true with regard to the conclusions of the report by mr haarder whom i warmly congratulate
i must also underline the intention to develop a vigorous policy on the integration of third country nationals legally resident on eu member state territory
we were once again told that this system has to be developed in order to correctly implement the dublin convention
furthermore the commission has as we know started to work on this and preparations for establishing a central unit are under way
we do not agree that the council should reserve for itself the powers of implementation of the system
now there are no longer any excuses and it is duty-bound to pay and the council cannot wash its hands
the european parliament must approve any secondary legislation that might have a bearing on these fundamental rights
i put the point that the containment by russia of arms flows from russia would be a very welcome step forward in terms of shared efforts to combat terrorism
another point that i would like to make is that we can learn from the past
would you be in favor of establishing a forum of this kind
madam president commissioner
that was done into the autumn and i have been assured that the issues that were drawn to the attention of the french authorities during that exercise have been addressed substantially in the responses by the french authorities
the first is this it must be made clear who is negotiating on the us side
what can we negotiate
yesterday we had a talk with the american minister for transport
firstly there must be a concerted world-wide effort to produce more stringent noise standards for aircraft
i believe this warrants some reflection
histrionics do not help they merely create unnecessary fronts
the ferber report is a very courageous exposition of the present and future needs of parliament
commissioner schreyer i should like to ask you if you can really tell us which budgetary lines create maintain or destroy factories and or jobs
these are extremely serious matters involving high-ranking personalities but it is all still perfectly concealed completely outside the scope of the justice system
these two sets of subjects overlap
this briefly is the council 's position on the work in progress or already concluded in the area of the lawful interception of telecommunications
the aim of export controls is to try to avoid undesired proliferation of these products to certain countries and to criminal organizations
of course i would like to add that that is something which is of serious concern
joint motion for a resolution on mediterranean policy
mrs klamt has presented a good report today
they all asked me - and i am very willing to act as their messenger - to thank you for your speech which made us proud to be members of this house
madam president if i have understood correctly the liberal group has moved that the point concerning the non-proliferation treaty be replaced by iraq
in my own committee this report was adopted with 27 votes in favor and one abstention
in the area of child pornography in particular where the rights of children are continually being trampled underfoot there is an urgent need for global regulation
while i support the action stipulated by the report and i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur i still think the proposed measures do not match up to the scale of the problem before us
we saw the need during the war in kosovo
i think that adopting this fund contribute to showing that in this area the european union as such can provide added value for the efforts of each individual member state
bse and dioxin are only the best known watchwords in this area which repeatedly make many in the european union flinch and ask questions to which we as those with political responsibility must provide answers
it will not have the option to get involved quickly and unbureaucratically on the basis of safeguard clauses
not reducing the list but extending it a little further since the commission has made nine proposals either to add certain additives to the list or to extend the uses of some already authorised additives
all the measures called for must be carried out by the deadline set
i will quote shakespeare
the stauner report including the explanatory note - which i fully support by the way - is very critical of the european commission
this will ensure that agricultural expenditure is treated like any other expenditure involving eu resources and this will strengthen parliament 's power of intervention
it is not a question of reducing control but of making it more efficient
the internet has created an entirely new situation where the duplication sale and distribution of child pornography is concerned
it is of course all well and good to have the strategic goal of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world with a view to creating sustainable growth
so we are concerned with the substantive follow-up as well
it is not an ideal solution
labels must be easy for consumers to understand which is why the information needs to be kept to a minimum
however i shall ensure that the council is informed of your point of view
i also accept proposed amendment no 19 second part which makes provision for a simplification for cattle pastured on the alps in the summer
the eu countries have completely different cultures
on the one hand competition policy is the key to the social market economy on the other hand however it is also the most robust instrument of economic policy that the european community has at its disposal
the policy is implicitly included in the report but i still think that in a sense not dealing with it now is a missed opportunity
that does not however detract from the deep appreciation which we have for this report
there is no justification for this in our eyes
institutional proposals on particular issues without prior clarification of the basic philosophy of tomorrow 's union of 27 are not convincing
my friend and fellow commissioner chris patten can confirm this assessment of the situation as regards these questions
another specific point i would like to raise concerns the european commission
president commissioner we are faced with a fundamental difficulty in the exercise in which we are involved in maintaining the balance between enlarging the eu and reforming the institutions to make that enlargement possible
agricultural statistics for the period 1993-2003
there is no point in denying anything in this case either
there can be no question of a majority of meps deciding the location of the seat of this parliament here against the views of the others we must respect the edinburgh compromise
there have been a number of allegations about an inadequate european response to the crisis
i must clarify however that the council considers that without serbia our common efforts will be incomplete
that is what is also in europe 's interests
in common with the legislators in many member states our position is that one can only talk in terms of pensions if life risks such as invalidity longevity and surviving dependants are covered
leaving this kind of decision to the individual is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity
freedom of choice is emphatically a good thing
there are of course many risks with equity investments but there are even greater risks to europe with stagnant economies
an example of this can be found in an area as apparently banal as urban transport
after having expressed my thanks once again to the rapporteur mrs palacio vallelersundi i would now like to move on to remarks made by mr berenguer fuster
the final ruling does not affect our intra-community support system
if a union of 28 member states is to be successful it must obviously have a flexible structure
the members of the commission work for the whole union and are important if a consensus between the member states is to be achieved
b5-0344 two thousand ninety seven by mr cox baroness nicholson of winterbourne and mr haarder on behalf of the eldr group on iraq
if iran claims to respect human rights trials like this should never be allowed to happen
it is clear that mugabe who has become unpopular through his mismanagement of the economy and his exploits in the congo intends to do everything necessary to stay in power
at the request of mr sakellariou the motion for resolution b5-0350 two thousand ninety nine has been withdrawn
in this respect the commission would like to maintain the existing scheme in which the selection of subsidised products is a matter for the commission
we do have individual opinions within our group
this goes hand in hand with efficiency
mr president those of us who represent scotland in this house were very grateful when this year the parliament decided to make its office in edinburgh permanent
it offers our citizens and the media the opportunity to have hands-on access to documents themselves and draw their own conclusions instead of being dependent on those of the commission
i consider it very important
what has been done to regulate aircraft to date
i took part in this morning 's action and i did not appreciate criticism from members who interpreted it as an anti-strasbourg maneuver
the entire transport policy needs to be revised in order to curb or even reduce air transport and related noise pollution
this is a matter which has extremely serious political repercussions
i have taken note of your proposal
i heard you say there would not be cuts against the poverty lines
competition also leads to lower costs
on the contrary the situation will deteriorate
the opening up of the markets means that the sector has evolved in very diverse ways
we must therefore try to ensure that aircraft are modernized
a malicious thought has come to me what will become of the petty national protectionist behavior which we have witnessed in recent years
europe has always been one of the highest-producing continents in the agricultural sector
i should like at this point to return to one aspect i consider more fundamental
in the past there was the problem that people had to cope with a foreign language foreign laws and so on
small projects can be planned and implemented efficiently by the institutions and organizations on the ground
let us see them ratify it
we pointed out on a previous occasion that it is strange that there are still no common provisions for fighting scrapie despite the fact that scrapie and bse have somehow been linked since the beginning
i would remind those present that with our additional safety measures we in the uk are only exporting to the community de-boned carcasses which have gone through maximum checks and security
the present situation is not good for patients or doctors alike - they have our life in their hands
i would very much appreciate clarification of those two questions by one or other commissioner
i thank parliament for what i sense to be a more than positive reception because the critical notes that i have heard are of a kind that i would tend to interpret as enthusiastic support
the czech republic has already applied for transition periods for the acquisition of land by foreigners and this will have an impact on services
transition periods must be very very limited in both scope and duration especially where the internal market is at stake
i am glad that this one has gone smoothly
we should be very clear about this too so as to ensure that these issues are brought into line
i welcome their launching of a project aimed at harmonising its members ' safety rules and practices
social security arrangements must be critically examined and social expenditure reduced but savings can also be made on social expenditure by making higher employment the top economic objective
this must also have a noticeable effect on practical politics
parliament adopted the resolution
thank you very much commissioner
rapporteur ladies and gentlemen in nineteen ninety three the european union undertook to open up the telecommunications market
women are very much absent in the media
this is not just the freedom and autonomy of the individual but also the freedom of social groups to express ethnic cultural religious political and spiritual affiliations and convictions
i regret that the group of the european people 's party christian democrats and european democrats have quoted rule 115 because the last version of the text which was the french one was actually issued at 1.02 a.m.
applause
trafficking in women is an important type of trade for organised crime which regards human beings as goods to be bought and sold
the bureau is looking at the working methods of parliament
being forced into part-time work is clearly a source of poverty which is why we oppose this
there are a few things which would add to and strengthen the text
we will not be voting in favor of this or rather we will be voting against this
social groups political parties parliaments meps and international conferences have proposed and have insisted that we legislate against the huge issue of racism and the conduct of organised society
initially i was against racism being taken separately
in both of those cases we see the danger of placing the burden of proof on the accused
motivations are many and varied
they demonstrate that the member states parliament and the commission are serious about the long-term eradication of discrimination and racism
the first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
in nineteen fifty two lee kuan yew the newly elected prime minister of singapore said my ambition is to make singapore emulate sri lanka in prosperity education and standard of living
they are targeting the independent press because it is a major channel for reformists
in the country itself entire population groups have been displaced in order to break up the minority groups
it has to be said however that the incidence of slavery is increasing despite the fact that we have now entered the twenty-first century
the tampere conclusions noted that the union needed a comprehensive approach to the phenomenon of immigration which is clearly linked to a whole series of political questions which have remained unanswered
firstly the minutes state that mr medina ortega ' questioned whether the letter from the committee 's chairman truly reflected the opinion of the committee as a whole '
each country tends to have their preferred flag use
parliament adopted the legislative resolution explanation of vote
this is better than doing nothing at all
i just wanted to ask whether mrs van der laan is here or have i missed her as well
i believe that a proposal by the conference of presidents can be objected to but the rules of procedure are very clear it is the conference of presidents which must make the proposal
whatever the dimensions the information will remain ineffective
why not talk about this processing
it would be very much the logical thing to do and perhaps the commission could give some thought to the matter
we must correct that anomaly
i therefore welcome with open arms the dvb group 's recommendation of the multimedia home platform as a possible standard
regulatory measures will be required to promote interoperability between the networks and devices that will be used to access digital tv and interactive services
and that is what we are constantly trying to achieve maintaining social cohesion with no loss of competitiveness
it must be pointed out that to date the matter of including sport in the treaty establishing the european community at the intergovernmental conference has not been raised by any member state or by the european commission
so perhaps colleagues should be cautious before we criticise this proposal
i would argue that excessively high taxes and restrictive monopolies are in any case in themselves a bad thing but they are even worse when camouflaged and justified by the alleged morality of policies protecting the common good
i am not saying that there is no reason to be worried
it may well be that mr beysen 's report hides a deceptively complex set of variables that the commission has had to deal with
this time we have to make a difference
in a number of areas the outcome document goes far beyond what was achieved five years ago at beijing - a conference which i remember observing from slightly closer than would have been the case today
i believe this conference has given hope to all those millions of women who are without fundamental human rights and we need a further follow-up conference in five years ' time
the first concerns the tendency of delegations to speak on behalf of our parliament
would commissioner patten agree with me there
the aim of these measures will be to consolidate the climate of security and harmonisation between these two countries
one of the main problems was the question of retention of title whereby the vendor retains ownership of the goods pending full payment
if there is one person responsible for this issue it is the president of the european union who must now correct his error
all the electorate has been allowed to do is shuffle the deck chairs on the deck of the titanic
however certain issues must be raised
we need to be very clear about that here
i am unhappy about adding turkey to the list of candidate countries that are eligible for support from the emcdda
i do share his concerns particularly the one he expressed in amendment no 13
although we have come a long way and we are making every effort now i feel that we still have a long way to go
it was one of the best atmospheres i have experienced at a cup final
this absurd debate demonstrates that a provan report on urgent procedures would be welcome because the prime minister of portugal has been waiting an hour for us to finish
the prime minister again referred to the importance of that
where is the sense in such a contradiction
we should be putting all the weight we possibly can behind india and attempting to make china see that chinese citizens truly deserve to have democracy
i also think however that the institutional unity of the european union needs to be protected
a parallel development could create new political openings and constitute progress because the various interests would be directly dependent upon one another
there are states such as the united kingdom or germany which have gone much further than the directive
we are aware that steps have been taken that will hopefully bring about a change in this situation before long
mr president thank you very much for your generosity and thanks also to my fellow member for his understanding and kindness
today let me simply stress an obvious point which is moreover the crux of what we want to achieve in nice and beyond
none of these things are characteristic of intergovernmentalism
this accelerated uniformisation the origin of the single model runs counter to the very thing that we strive to safeguard every day namely diversity
i have every confidence in jacques chirac president-in-office of the council and in his ability along with our partners within the european union to meet these historic challenges
we must educate young people to stand up for principles and the fight against drugs and the development of the social function of sport may well play a significant part in this
upon arrival their documents are often seized as a result of which they are completely at the mercy of crime syndicates
everyone will complain and europe will not have made any progress
permit me to make a few comments on the traditional aspects of the ad hoc procedure
this is almost a carbon copy of the procedure for the two thousand ninety nine budget
what initiatives does the council intend to take to ensure that the other member states also ratify the statute
this building will be for the needs of the staff required to implement the policy
external action - which is already now overburdened
fourthly regulated grid access with set prices following the telecommunications example is the best way of ensuring that small and medium-sized companies and smaller works departments receive equal treatment
we believe that we have to support renewable energy sources as much as possible
the cost of the validation process also warrants discussion
policy-makers use analysis undertaken using models developed by the ecb staff in some cases with input from staff of national central banks as one input among others into their policy assessments and decisions
when the federal reserve hikes its base rate by 25 points the european central bank follows suit when the federal reserve adds 50 points the central bank does likewise a few weeks later
the president declared the common position approved as amended
there is only one question which arises whether we should look at one particular system which might be an invasion of privacy or at all potential systems that might be an invasion of privacy
before the vote on amendment no 26 lehne ppe-de
the european parliament proposed numerous other provisions at first reading mainly seeking to extend the information requirements of the member states
for this reason i do not support an amendment to the financial perspectives in the area of appropriations under external action
for this reason and for other reasons but especially for this reason it is important that consumers should not be cheated when they convert their money into euros
i have therefore called for the setting up of local hotlines within every local community to ensure that citizens can report improper price increases in a way which is simple and easy
it is a shame that the government will not accept this proposal but at least it will serve to teach the italian pensioner citizens the value of the euro
i am simply pointing out that the commissioner should not give the impression that there is no room for conciliation on this
mr president i am very grateful for this opportunity to inform parliament about a decision which was taken by the commission this morning relating to a proposal for a regulation to create a community patent
secondly the decision to convert the office in munich into an eu agency has to be approved unanimously by fifteen governments
apparently the commission is discussing a paper with the member states without even informing parliament that it is doing so
although all the eu member states have signed the statute only italy unfortunately has ratified it
however such a complex and accident-prone area geographically requires projects which we are working on which need time to develop
so far as the arguments against the best available technology are concerned they do not stand up to scrutiny
despite the fact that the european union 's forestry strategy is a step forward in terms of ideas it is yet to have any practical expression
mr president the content of the regulation being discussed here is based on the situation that existed at the end of the 1980s but since then things have changed greatly
in my opinion all hollywood wants is a worthy opponent
they have not made such a declaration they did promise us something but we set no store by promises
mr president on monday i made a point of order about president nicole fontaine 's reported comments in the british press regarding her recent visit with her majesty queen elizabeth ii
the regional ombudsmen and similar bodies were invited to a meeting in florence last year in which mr gemelli the chairman of the committee on petitions also attended
i would urge members who are not familiar with the committee on petitions to read these reports
the aim of the committee on petitions itself is to provide a good and effective service for individuals within the european union and for civil society generally
the free movement of persons is one of the basic freedoms achieved through european integration
it is a clear problem that we need to address
they cannot be left to the member states
but the commissioner for budgets does not have the right to refuse to tell us how many millions the commission has paid to this firm over the past years
it is on the basis of these statements that controls can be carried out
the community eco-management and audit scheme known as emas afforded an opportunity to eu companies to secure accreditation that they are implementing good environmental practices within their operations
mr president this house is appealing to the governor of virginia to spare the life of a man derek rocco barnabei sentenced to death who is in all probability innocent
the journalists were prevented from doing their job and were beaten up thrown to the ground and arrested
i believe this parliament is stretching the bounds of its credibility
i would like to hear whether this is actually a legal procedure for us to be voting on now
we shall not give up
mr president
in my opinion however the multinational giants are the big problem and co-operation between the authorities is needed in this area also so that these regulations might enter into force before enlargement
i therefore think that when people start having to face the consequences progress will be made in the matter both within the union and in other respects
if anyone adopted a unilateral stance on these occasions it was the british government which without any prior consultation whatsoever adopted a position in favor of therapeutic cloning
as is well known the meda program comes within the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnership which was created after the barcelona declaration of november nineteen ninety five
another important point raised by mr galeote quecedo is that of a lack of coordination in the foreign policy of the eu member states which he believes to be essential to the visibility and effectiveness of the cfsp
i believe that it limits itself to adhering pragmatically to the community method and that it clearly demonstrates that joint diplomacy is one of the fundamental aspects of the visibility of the european union 's external action
what then do these decisions imply
the liberal party 's five members of the european parliament support the efforts in this report to give better diplomatic training to those ec officials who work in the commission 's delegations

by way of background to racist violence in the new federal states she quotes the dramatically high percentage of racist attitudes among the population including the fact that racism is being elevated to a kind of youth culture

broadly speaking the compromise articles do not prejudice legislation of the member state to which the contract pertains
in addition parliament asked for a reform of the rules on whistle-blowers and for disciplinary procedures the commission ensured that this reform was made
it must be said that the same criticisms are also made of member states
these range from identification of centralised procedures inappropriate given the urgency with which actions have to be carried out to the fact that the commission found itself confronted with various faits accomplis which subsequently had to be financed
we were very critical of it at the time of the annual report but i think these special reports are very valuable
the ecb has commented on the criticism and stated among other things that it has improved its procedures and taken the criticism of its project management on board
this is essential since smes form 99.8 of all firms and employ 66 of the european workforce

i see this difficult delicate compromise as a step forward for apart from anything else it includes many of the points proposed by parliament at first reading

it is to be welcomed that the environmental aspects now fall within the scope of the directive
thank you very much mr berenguer

there will not be a debate on this
yet again there is a public outcry against such inconceivable cruelty
the report concerns aspects of the agreement that are not covered by the so-called interim agreement i.e.services investment and aspects of intellectual property
a good example is the fact that the agreement foresees the almost total prohibition of performance requirements which will prevent the mexican side from specifying the terms on which it would like to see trade and foreign investment

from a cultural point of view and in terms of europe 's cultural claim we cannot sustain that for very long
secondly another form of cost distribution is in actual fact only fair
roaming warranted more detailed consideration
the balance now achieved will be a clear message to the council which it will also then have to take account of

another important proposal is that of linking the intelligent use of energy to what is being called the lisbon process
the commission the council and the european parliament have agreed that the four items are inadequate
in actual fact we should already be reaching an interinstitutional agreement on this
in fact it amounts to far too little if you consider that the swedish presidency is already approaching the half-way mark
lisbon gave us clear guidelines within which to find the courage to set decisive priorities and move forward using a method of open coordination between the member states
as regards community fraud and judicial matters it would be preferable and far more judicious to have recourse to eurojust

the use of lead is also becoming less common
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports
the council is developing its own military crisis management organization and has asked among others for 51 new posts in the second supplementary budget in the middle of the budgetary year

an agreement with morocco which is failing to materialise has in turn huge implications for spanish and portuguese fishermen

commission

in many countries the sound financing of future pension benefits has not been secured
we - and i am thinking of countries such as germany or in particular italy - are laying the foundations for there to be generations of poor pensioners
my specific question is is it true that there are still some eu institutions that have age barriers so that if you are over a certain age you cannot be employed by them
this was appalling of you
contrary to what the commission has suggested articles 30 31 and 32 of the euratom treaty are not applicable as the commission would be interfering with the safety of nuclear installations in respect of their technical operation
salvaging materials is highly labour-intensive yet the work is unattractive
this is not just any solution either
as you are all aware though miracles do not happen by themselves
what does the eu want when it comes to human rights
in my opinion this really is a field in which there will be a need for political courage and responsibility in the future too
once again therefore - congratulations
turkey still has a lot to do and has to get back down to work
the minutes from yesterday 's sitting have been distributed
the council reiterated its conclusions of december two thousand ninety nine regarding the measures to take with regard to the erika
it is the citizens that are hoping that galicia will be given appropriate assistance by the eu
as far as the oral question is concerned the commission does not have exact figures concerning the overall scale of voluntary and forced repatriation promoted by member states
in this connection the european union has a particular responsibility
that is why definitions must not be imposed through the back door
pt we have voted in favor of this report because as a result the funding of eur 27 million for the conversion of the spanish and portuguese fishing fleets which operated in moroccan waters will be ensured
on the basis of this process of defining regions a start can now be made on collecting statistical data
it is quite clear that the people who have opposed trans-european networks have voiced real and true concerns
the report measures human rights against this charter which is why there is not the slightest reference to the slavery introduced with new forms of work and to the decimation and commercialisation of social benefits
the debate is closed
in this area there is a lack of compatibility within the member states and practical cross-border cooperation is made utterly impossible by the completely incompatible technical standards involved
firstly we have industrial strategies favoring road transport and ' just-in-time ' management resulting in a greater number of journeys and greater dispersal and fragmentation
whilst i am aware that not everyone will share my point of view i hope you will all understand the importance of the issue
passenger transport by rail is a public service and must remain so
one reason is that the sncf is in the grip of the trade unions and is consequently becoming worse and worse at fulfilling its role as a public service
you have spoken of sustainable development and the protection of the environment
that is the view in the european countries where the vast majority of our people as mr prodi said is against a war in iraq and rightly so
lastly others myself included think and say that we must grasp the nettle
the country as a whole needs aid to be provided quickly but it must then be distributed fairly
what this indicates in general terms is that it is only with much hesitation that europeans will commit themselves to long-term involvement and do so in small stages
some men may have changed outwardly but on the inside they are still the same
it sets time limits graduated in accordance with the difficulties involved and it sets new standards of reference which should and will be respected
after all ladies and gentlemen let us be honest which of you would volunteer to be tested with new substances
does the european union currently have a fully credible partner
what is now needed is for priorities to be set out more clearly than before and decisive improvements made in key areas
i believe that the commission did its work perfectly because in march two thousand ninety nine it presented us with this first package of measures
in any event it is a supplementary question
the council also stressed that the principle of prevention the principle of compensating for environmental disasters at source and the polluter pays principle need to be applied in an appropriate manner to maritime transport
naturally no one can accept that an accident of this sort should lead to a disaster of such magnitude
the first comment relates to the institution itself
the european parliament should therefore support the main conclusions offered by mr markov who is responsible for this own-initiative report
the debate is closed
aquaculture gives rise to many problems
first of all i would like to congratulate mr martin on the excellent result
this is particularly necessary in those areas worst affected by drastic restructuring resulting from failure to sign fishing agreements or following the reform of the common fisheries policy
a few problems remain however especially for small-scale fishing and traditional fishing
only when sound scientific information is available will it be possible to decide on the nature of the measures needed to supplement those already in place
many african countries mess things up themselves
the osce mission must be allowed to stay as an aid to that process just as the russians are in kosovo
they use what i believe to be specious arguments for this in a letter to our president
then we said that we as a parliament wanted to visit the region
another very important matter is the considerable humanitarian aid provided by the european union
the inspectors are the eyes and ears of the international community
so we liberals salute the efforts of colin powell hans blix mohamed elbaradei and others for reinforcing the multilateral rule of law
whether we choose war or peace now depends first and foremost on the decisions saddam hussein makes and europe must ensure that the iraqi regime cooperates with the inspectors
there is therefore no reason to instigate a pre-emptive war
you remember what we said about the crisis in the middle east
already last october the government of north korea was reportedly running a secret uranium enrichment program in blatant violation of the kedo agreement
a meeting is only successful however if it is feared by the violators and applauded by the victims
the figures speak for themselves
a greater diversity of export products forms part of this
this summit should lead us to draw lessons for the eu 's internal policies
it is extremely important that patients realize that once a course of treatment has begun it must be finished
we carry some responsibility for that
action in this field is in everyone 's interest and should not be seen simply as a development aid issue but as contributing to improving health and reducing poverty in the developing countries
mr president this was the last time the porto alegre social forum and the world economic forum will take place on the same day
we are quite aware that in these areas nothing will be done without mobilising society itself
this is an incredibly important issue
and that is the last thing that the world will permit in the current very serious crisis
on the other hand the wto 's fundamental categories do not include issues of rural development environmental protection and animal welfare
agriculture constitutes an exception to the rule
while we often hear that the european union wants to proceed with integration too quickly in other areas this is typically a matter that people think should have been settled long ago
the meps of the communist party of greece voted against the report on belarus because it represents monumental intervention by the u in the internal affairs of an independent country
parliament has played an active and supportive role throughout the negotiation of this agreement
france and italy also have alps and the pyrenees are also very vulnerable
they are therefore fully informed of this
in the united states of america it is highly profitable and attracts a great deal of investment
mr president it is clear to me that we could easily have turned the 150 pages of the white paper on the commission 's transport policy into a 300-page vision
secondly there is a lot of movement in the european skies and this is now reflected in our legislation
it needs money
use benchmarking to promote and establish best practice to integrate smes in the e-economy
members of the public and businesses should also benefit from this treasure trove of information whose commercial value is difficult to put a figure on
but despite all of the agreement expressed in the debate so far i am still missing an essential point
mr president clearly the crisis currently plaguing the european union and the capitalist system as a whole will not be remedied with the measures proposed for the spring council
your ego will be flattered but the result will be seventeen thousand more unemployed each month as happened again in france last month
pt the current situation of publicly accessible re-use of public-sector information varies enormously from member state to member state both in terms of conditions and also of the costs of this re-use
at the moment the international community has put is faith in the inspectors
first of all as long as the inspectors are present it will be difficult for saddam hussein to manufacture prohibited weapons
i urge those same governments not to turn their backs on europe
i believe that if the importance of fundamental freedoms is overlooked there will be a visible risk of our policy becoming fragmented unilateral and irrational
last year the spanish government proposed the banning of several social organizations - media and cultural associations - that had denounced the political repression suffered by basque dissidents
finally on the very important issue raised by mr pirker i can guarantee that we are preparing for the possibility of a mass influx
moreover we have had plenty of time to do so for the opinion was i believe expressed last september
we may not have this meeting taking place in full daylight but i find it light enough in here to make the following remark
the harbor report also calls on the commission to calculate the economic costs of transposition delays
however what concerns the working classes of the european union is certainly not that but rather the avalanche of collective dismissals
nothing has happened
fr i have voted in favor of this report even though on certain points my assessment and even my approach were in some ways different
we will have to pay specific attention to prisoners
employees should have new rights in companies at all levels
they want a peaceful future for their children the children of iraq and the children of the world
i therefore think that it is important to create a good balance and since september 11 we have naturally also had to look at security aspects
we have already requested that countries such as tanzania mozambique and bangladesh liberalise their water sectors for example
i would like to say something about two matters
i believe it is important that we can hold a debate and that you can present your arguments
so far the following funds have been programmed for such compensation payments under the structural funds belgium has set aside eur 800 000 denmark eur 1.6 million the netherlands eur 1.3 million and france eur 3.5 million
i hope that report will include the proposals for two new conference rooms here
there are four main european policies which will contribute to enlargement cohesion policy the common agricultural policy the tens policy and the policy for cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises
the debate should be linked to the debate on budget guidelines for two thousand ninety nine
other honorable members will speak on further aspects of our stance
reforming the budgetary procedure is by no means a technical issue that can only be handled by specialists
i am very pleased that you are now president of parliament but i should just like to talk about this directive
furthermore we must also become much better at monitoring and ensuring that the member states do in fact feel bound by the fine promises given at the lisbon summit and this also applies to the large countries
the vote will take place next thursday
mr president i am very glad that you know what i am going to say because i did not intend to say what you have suggested
mrs flemming parliament is of course free to make its own decisions and i would consider it a worthwhile initiative if it were to go along with the suggestion that you have just made
mr president mrs izquierdo rojo i can tell you that what you said about parodies certainly rings true with me
that is what we should keep as our basis what we must be rigorous about keeping as our basis
europe must devise a policy of her own
this has not happened however
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen to start with i wish to thank all the parties concerned for their excellent levels of cooperation in achieving what is a constructive solution
never since the end of the cold war has there been on a world-wide scale such a powerful camp clearly in favor of peace and promoting the law and multilateral cooperation
the west the so-called international community and europe have been completely shattered
the proud declarations concerning the common foreign and security policy that are usually made on solemn occasions have of course proved brittle when they have been put to the test
first of all we are a community of values which respects differences of opinion - and there are differences - and we want the new countries joining us to join a democratic society
i think that the turkish parliament really is acquiring democratic momentum which we must respect and build on
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed
this will not affect the right of members to receive answers now
mr president
that would not be enough to halt the progress of misogyny and violence against women which is growing in the poverty and ghettos of working-class areas but it would curb the deterioration of women 's standard of living
my second point is that i am very pleased that the commission is finally intending to take measures against a former commissioner
we are unhappy however with the low recovery rate which has fallen considerably
the need to pay special attention to this is justified and we have asked for this very often
all the points in it are important but the new priorities in the whitehead report introduce a succession of others ranging from important to less important
what this is about is increasing the level of employment in these regions
we all know that practices such as torture of prisoners the involvement of the army and police in trafficking of women and children and excessive pre-trial detention are commonplace
a ban on foreign investments should be introduced
if the european union wishes to exist it must be given the means to do so
this means that we in this house call on all the member states all the governments of europe to make neither political nor military contributions to this war
consequently in this slightly ridiculous debate there is only one thing to say ' the european union is dead
there must be one voice that speaks for freedom democracy and human rights and not only on our own continent
a war in which troops from some member states are fighting in the region
this parliament must not fall in with the logic of war it must call for the un general assembly to convene immediately in order to demand a cease-fire
yes but we cannot deny that the european union is experiencing a real crisis
words such as liberty democracy and the condemnation of saddam hussein 's dictatorship are merely hypocrisy to conceal a war of banditry
we must not allow our capacity for action to be destroyed now by a dispute about who did what badly three or four weeks ago or six months ago with this war as the result of it
its staffing regulations are in need of reform now more than ever if we are to successfully modernize its personnel policy
it is well known that water companies have fewer and fewer opportunities to obtain clean drinking water
the commission believes that it is in the community 's interest to be associated with an initiative of this kind particularly against the background of creating the european research area
it beggars belief that in some developing countries for example there is a shortage of teachers because half of the teaching workforce has aids
in his excellent report the rapporteur also dotted a few more i 's and crossed a few more t 's
once again we have taken the second step before the first
like the brussels council of 20 march last we hope that this combat will result in a free sovereign iraq whose regime does not pose a threat to its neighbors or to its own people
it is the season for organised school trips
mr president we have an excellent opportunity today to debate and understand certain basic public health issues and advance them at european union level
amendments nos 8 and 9 were both proposed by the european parliament at first reading as well
what is important now is that we have high-quality training courses and that there are authorised training centres
this program has three main pillars
every time we receive groups of visitors we have to explain it all over again
we therefore proceeded pragmatically and noted the committee 's previous vote in the case of motions that were retabled taking a vote on new motions of which there were only a few
as a former member of the committee on budgetary control i myself am also guilty
parliament is doing the eu a disservice by year after year turning a blind eye to the fact that the reforms requested by the group of wise men in nineteen ninety nine have still not been implemented
this is what you must say '
is this really logical
when it comes to evaluations criteria have to be laid down
the debate is closed
my question is when will the stability pact be reviewed so that we can be sure of public investment job creation improved purchasing power and effective measures to tackle poverty and social exclusion
furthermore i am afraid that two subjects are missing from the guidelines for employment but we shall shortly be speaking about these further in our committees
i should like to answer mr bowe 's question
mr president i am going to ask two very short supplementary questions
now i would just like to ask you further whether you can give me answers on two specific points
with these reports we are calling once again today for greater european parliament involvement in the europol budget procedure and for europol to be funded through the community budget
i again want to underline the commission 's willingness to support any further efforts by the united nations to find even now a lasting political solution to the cyprus problem
above all else we must bring europe together and reconcile it both morally and intellectually
i venture to state before this parliament that our common core values in actual fact found expression through the way in which communism and dictatorship in the former eastern european countries were done away with
cyprus and nicosia have been divided for 29 years
the war in iraq has made us more aware of our weaknesses but that is no reason to change the basic philosophy entirely
let me make one more thing clear i believe that we need the atlantic alliance
we can look back on an intensive process of debate culminating in a public hearing on 29 january which involved more than three hundred experts from the eu and the united states
i commend the commission for taking this initiative under article 152
in short will the structure of a directive on organs not correspond closely to the present directive on tissues and cells
in my view we need very clear european legislation in this area
amendment 4 has been mentioned as requiring a new investigation into aspartame
we all want to significantly reduce the quantities used and the toxicity of the various ingredients in detergents
thirdly there seems to be a desire to bring forward measures on phosphates anaerobic biodegradability and organic ingredients other than surfactants
i also want to know - and that again is in our resolution - whether we will be sending a high-level representative
we welcome commissioner nielson 's commitment in november of last year to examine the possibilities of freeing up and reallocating old edf money
where collective defense is concerned we attach importance to nato 's remaining the indispensable link binding the united states to europe 's security interests and we continue to attach great importance to the maintenance of good transatlantic relations
these detract from its credibility
commissioner nielson must come before parliament at his earliest convenience to give an answer on this matter
he is now in prison
there was no confrontation between left and right of the sort i have previously described but rather a confrontation between north and south each being convinced that one method or another was better
the next item is the debate on the report a5-0129 two thousand ninety four by mr nicholson on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators
i too believe it is important to send a strong signal to the forthcoming council of ministers
i must say that i am also pleased that a level playing field is being created for all parties involved in creating environmental damage
my group and the european parliamentary labor party has some difficulty with the question of gmos not because we are against gmos but because we think this legislation might weaken existing gmo legislation
el the policy of restructuring the shipbuilding industry and the resultant cutbacks in it have resulted in tens of thousands of unemployed workers
the ep must be involved in this process specifically at the final meeting of the forum and in the exchanges of information between the institutions
an important theme in this report is parliament 's multilingualism
we have noted the increase for turkey romania and bulgaria which are quite diverse countries
so i look forward with eager expectation to what you are going to put before us on this perhaps you could respond to one or other of these questions right now
that distorts the competition among them
neither one nor the other stood up against the position of the united states on a preventive strike leaving the way clear for the crime to be repeated
the sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m.and resumed at 12.30 p.m.
the text adopted by parliament is going to breed confusion
i think it will inasmuch as it will oblige member states and candidate countries to speed up the ratification of the european texts that form the basis of this agreement
in the union member states have not yet ratified our decision on money laundering or the framework directive on terrorism
the borders of the union will also shift to croatia which we hope will participate in the next enlargement round alongside romania and bulgaria
with the border between the eu and russia becoming much longer than before we must make dramatic improvements to cross-border cooperation
i believe we have exhausted the topic of the points raised by mr ortuondo
i am sure he will be aware of efforts to reach agreement on the reform of the common agricultural policy in advance of the world trade agreement and the june deadline which the committee has set
mr president i would like to salute your leadership
i should like to hear the commissioner 's response to this point
we know the emotional pain and human tragedy that resulted largely because of the controversy about vaccination
the reference to the need to avoid imposing foreign models is also highly welcome - ownership has to be promoted
when we talk about this international protection for audiovisual performers that we desire what do we mean by it
' united we stand and united we fall ' the refrain might go
i have written to these commissioners

as i found out with mr goebbels and mr van den bos when we went to ethiopia these people ask only for water seed peace and security
mr president the rich and powerful of the world gathered in evian in order to discuss international security development and economic stability
i would ask mr mombaur to provide the presidency with a written version of the initial statement he made regarding errors in the voting list in order to avoid further errors
does it not foster distortion of competition in favor of the larger states and energy-producing companies as against smaller ones
we also propose that the inspection requirements be looked at
i believe that in taking on board many of your expectations these revisions now reflect the shared views of all parties
that is important for it is not enough just to increase levels of employment as is done in periods of prosperity
i wish however to say that i shall vote in such a way that we preserve unity in this house
i hope you will think again when you come to vote on it in this vote today
pt i voted against this report because i believe that it says nothing new
for this reason i did not vote for the report
explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with article 137 1 of the rules of procedure
despite pronouncements to the contrary euro-mediterranean relations were and remain unequally priced
ultimately the commission also has to take care that the whole package should retain its coherence
indeed as the rapporteur says in his justification the objective must be to consolidate the structure of producer organizations
one of the problems we have always had in the common agricultural policy is that the funding has gone to multinationals such as supermarkets and not actually got down to the farmers

however it is not the case with catalonia
we are all aware of the current strikes about the pensions reform
in short ecology and economy go hand in hand
the issues of iraq transatlantic relations and international developments in general recently created new challenges in the field of the european security and defense policy
the draft constitution is not progress but a large step backwards in history to the time before the introduction of democracy when the king asked for advice but took the decisions himself
the commission sensibly suggested looking at ways of allowing legal routes for migration
i say nine-and-a-half because cyprus is joining as a divided country but that is an insignificant detail which we should not allow to overshadow the glory of great europe
we need to be able to tell those countries exactly where there are still problems but we also need to be able to tell them where progress has been made
it was an irresponsible amendment which seeks to maintain regulations ec nos 2847 93 and 685 95 for a period of 10 years
as you know turkey is an important partner of the union with which we have maintained contractual relations for a very long time
political clarity is something from which ultimately all parties involved benefit
the report which is very constructive nonetheless holds the door clearly open in order to facilitate the future accession of turkey
the action plan may perhaps now be outdated but that does not apply to the new transatlantic agenda
it is about adding to european union competences taking forward the political ambition of european integration and empowerment
i sincerely hope nigeria will take note and take action
our aim is for the council to examine these two reports so that the european council can issue guidelines for further action in these sectors
question no 13 by marco cappato h-0333 03
we should recall that an intergovernmental method may not be introduced indirectly
what is the reality in europe
despite advances in diagnosis and treatment breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women aged 35 to 55
thirdly we need to make sure that organizations like europa donna which have done so much work across europe on the issue of breast cancer awareness are given the support they deserve
mr president commissioner on my last visit to the gynaecologist she told me that the risk in belgium has risen from one woman in 10 to one woman in eight
adequate food controls are important in order to guarantee the greatest possible protection of consumers
we need food safety
i would therefore say that there will be sufficient room for maneuver in this matter to amend shall we say the wording should this be necessary to ensure that this is the case
rural development cannot exist without farmers and agricultural production
the june movement wishes to see the aid completely done away with and is unable to support a redistribution of the aid whereby new areas are brought under the umbrella of aid arrangements of one kind or another
on the other hand there is a serious omission in that it does not clearly state the right of the kurdish people to self determination in accordance with the united nations charter
up to now this government has also refused to acknowledge these problems and seems not to be doing very much about them
there is absolutely no democracy whatsoever and the people are being kept ignorant
there are daily troubles in zimbabwe food and fuel are increasingly in short supply inflation is running at 50 a month and consumer prices will rise by 300 at least in the next few months
i would have liked to see majority voting in foreign policy - but this is something which i hope we can still discuss during the negotiations on part iii
i am deeply concerned about the european union 's policy towards iran
this is still the current cfsp 's strongest asset
the more democracies there are the less the risk of war
both sides of industry are following these developments very closely with us in a sectoral social committee
what is needed commissioner for the sector 's survival at european level and for the continued existence of the millions of jobs that are at stake is above all a defensive trade policy
they are difficult for us to accept
i believe that competition between different companies is then to be preferred to monopolies irrespective of whether they are public or private
the commission cannot therefore accept amendment no 7
parliament 's proposals have not been adopted because they are said to fall outside the scope of this directive
it is interesting that the swedish commissioner is here
in particular we consider the part dedicated to this point to be unsatisfactory
i hope your vocal chords recover soon mr stevenson
if the would-be european political parties really possessed the solid base that they claim to have then let them be funded by that base in other words by the national citizens and political parties
it comes from a member of parliament who is an opponent of mr cohn-bendit and who has used these accusations as one of the elements of his political battle
however since that cannot happen a requirement has been proposed which moreover already exists indirectly according to which the basic principles of the legislation must at any event always be observed including by independent territorial legislation
our failure over iraq also helped you adopt two remarkable documents at thessaloniki mr solana 's eu security strategy and the council 's declaration on weapons of mass destruction
we will also forever associate it with a sense of gratitude
this has to change in the future and the convention needs to make a contribution to achieving this
the greek presidency respected the institution of the convention and its results and thus politically - and this is important - the institution of the convention was established as one of the major accomplishments of european democracy
in the future we need a common asylum and refugee policy based upon generosity and humanity
in addition consumers are given the necessary information so that they are informed when they want to buy a product
the common position adopted by the council in march is both balanced and rational
although enlargement is one specific recommendation of the g10 clearly our responses to each recommendation need to adequately reflect the changing environment within the european union
the issue is still being discussed in the wto context on the one hand
i expect and hope there will be some outcome on this before cancun
question no 30 which was going to be put first will be put later in order to coincide with the replies from mr lamy
the technology of electronic identification for sheep and goats has progressed to such a stage that it can now be applied
i would remind all my fellow members of the rules of the game
with the precautionary principle in mind parabens polysorbates and aluminium phosphates should be banned immediately
one final response perhaps commissioner
it is a lot wiser ecologically if this wood is burnt as an energy source in people 's houses
unfortunately we have to say that it has also been at the expense of our democratic procedures
mr president i appreciate what has been achieved especially the benchmarking and for that i thank my fellow members in particular mr blokland and once again the rapporteur
in fact as far as the trading standards officers in my home city of hull are concerned this has been a running campaign against chicken cheats for over six years
adjustment of the multi-annual programs is also important in the light of enlargement
one of the most important features of this was the creation of a ' scrapping fund ' which was to start before the end of this year
so far as insurance against eventualities such as disasters in agriculture is concerned we are willing to look very closely at the survey and the expert report
my thanks to them also go to all the members of this house who have participated in the convention including the chairman of our group in the convention elmar brok
the problem lies mr berlusconi in the fact that we have heard so many contradictions from italy in recent months
the fortunate increase in life expectancy together with shorter working lives have led to a decrease in the number of people actively employed as compared with the number of retired people
that obviously presents a problem of funding for the public systems operating on a distribution basis
this has caused a reduction in all the financial assets invested in shareholdings and has caused a critical cut in all their returns
.
that concludes voting time
so it is vital that we should not deceive ourselves
mr president the commission proposal had the merit - we pay tribute to the commissioner mrs de palacio for this - of courageously raising this issue with force and with urgency and within the deadlines
it may well be that closer integration in the heart of the eu is essential but there is probably no need for it in the peripheral regions given their special circumstances
it is very clear that we are anxious to find a solution
it is unfortunate that parliament at first reading stage did not see it as really important that the right to free transport should be balanced against the rights of people and of the environment on transit routes
that this is a company strategy - and of course it is not the only company to do this - was confirmed to me by the ground staff at the airport and by many consumer associations
the commission agrees with and accepts these suggestions
you will also not be surprised that i cannot share the view that the ecb 's decision-making process might have been delayed by the fact that most governing council decisions have so far been taken by consensus
for catalans whether french or spanish it means that we once again have a common currency which has not been the case since the disastrous treaty of the pyrenees in 1659
madam president i too should like to start by congratulating our rapporteur mrs ghilardotti on her enormous contribution to the promotion and highlighting of the relatively new concept of gender budgeting
mr president i have a technical amendment to make concerning the wording of amendment no 3 and also the original text to which this amendment applies
the minutes were approved
at a time when we are adopting ' gender budgeting ' we can only insist on the need to be able to quantify and assess this participation accurately
the vote will take place this afternoon
that problem however is still not being solved because there is a disregard for the existing safeguards
the main donor countries are holding a dialogue with the ugandan government in order to promote a policy in the north to facilitate the full integration of the northern districts into the rest of the country
where transport sector employers are concerned profit comes well before safety
as mr savary reminded us just now it was because the floods were so serious that we resurrected this solidarity fund which had been abolished in the past
when the directive for a large and liquid internal market is prepared account must be taken of the need for special rules at national level not to be allowed to increase unchecked
it is of vital importance to bridge these differences by fostering long-term balanced and polycentric development throughout our european union
we know from other areas how often this turns out to be extremely difficult to do particularly when we have to do business with the usa
the work done by the rapporteur mrs lambert is thus of the greatest importance and i congratulate her
you then pay relatively little in taxes in belgium and receive an awful lot of social benefits in denmark
that too brings this agreement into line with those with other third countries and also makes it possible for us to monitor the fishing effort
the other practical question concerns the blue box
by its very nature our agriculture mandate is limited by the present state of cap reforms
it follows that this is a task for the member state setting the project in motion
what matters now for example is whether in andalusia you decouple everything or whether in animal husbandry perhaps you retain certain coupled elements with the stipulation that this task could under certain circumstances devolve upon the rural communities
thank you very much commissioner
the recognition of the disabled as people with rights is part of the realisation of the idea of the functioning of democracy
the victim should not have to flee should not have to hide should be able to remain in their home in their own environment with sufficient protection and far away from the aggressor

furthermore the cuban government will apparently refuse to negotiate directly with the member states and the commission on development cooperation themes programs and projects and will only agree to deal with ngos on such issues
ladies and gentlemen a new phase has now started we must finish off the excellent work of the convention wisely resolutely and with courage
it creates a europe which is also imbued with these ideas
mr president of the convention you once asked the convention a question that was simultaneously pertinent and impertinent and to which we have never had a reply
however this requires a total break with big shipping business a break that the eu cannot and does not want
any attempt to continue to use the un to get the usa ' out of a fix ' and to continue the occupation is bound to fail
memories of the criminal invasions of yugoslavia afghanistan and iraq are still fresh
i do not think it is appropriate to open negotiations on these issues
although this has been a rather low-key debate today this report has been the subject of very intensive discussions among members of this house in recent days and indeed in recent weeks not only in the meeting rooms
we therefore need to revise our trade policy towards developing countries by giving priority to the aspirations and objectives of trade policy and to those of the commissioner responsible for development
they are tasks which are way beyond you if you are physically or mentally ill or disabled
for many acp governments non-state actors are still synonymous with opposition
it is not a question of substance as you know very well that we are of the same opinion in that respect
there should also be sufficient resources allocated to it for it to function effectively in an enlarged union
that is what i understand from the reply i have been given
i thank mr perry for accepting my own amendments on access in paragraph 44
the other reason is the governments ' and also the commission 's fear of using community resources for subsidies which are not directed towards farmers or large public works
applause from the right
i am sorry but i am not changing my opinion
only if the european union restores trust and credibility shows understanding and solidarity will it have the necessary influence to help things get better in and with cuba
we however have a message to give to him
mr president last july i tabled an oral question to the commission on renewing the scientific and technical cooperation agreement with israel
it is essential that the political stability of india as a nuclear regional superpower is upheld by all eu member states and all other democratic nations of the world
in this regard i was pleased to listen to mr posselt 's contribution
how unfortunate that expression sounds in this context
i very much welcomed your commencement in july of proceedings in respect of infringements of the treaties against ten member states that have not yet transposed even the measures decided on after erika
now that the proposals have been tabled we see a very inadequate implementation of the measures in the member states and i find out that the council of ministers has unanimously rejected the introduction of criminal sanctions
but neither should other practices which day by day drop by drop pollute our seas often in the face of inaction on the part of people who today are screaming blue murder
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen as we all know applications for asylum are normally processed by the first country that we can describe as a ' safe country ' with which an asylum-seeker makes contact
i hope that the european parliament will agree with the council and the european central bank that mr trichet is an excellent candidate for this important job
decisions will have to be taken on this issue and fresh impetus must come from the new president
i think that would take us much further forward
this system can be operated independently of the community 's legislative process
and no we do not want to undermine the successful open source community and linux technology in any way
as mr bolkestein has pointed out the european patent office has allowed itself to take this dangerous route to a certain extent as japanese jurisprudence has also done for example
an expanding market open to new horizons of lively criticism and fantasy such as the european market cannot allow itself to impose more regulations which would in actual fact further constrain development in the european nations
we and i believe the vast majority of speakers in this house commissioner believe that the standard form of protection is copyright
software interoperability and communications should furthermore be possible without huge licence fees
the creation of a special anti-pollution fleet
mr staes has the floor for a point of order
after punishing the fraud and improving administrative control of eurostat we need to pay attention to this
these are important matters and it is also clear that the people are in favor of a more assertive external policy 67 of europeans state that they support more european union in the world
we also seek a moderate increase in funding for the community initiative equal and for non-governmental organizations
the fact that it is not necessary to implement the suspending injunction does not of course at this stage mean that the commission has approved the aids
that government which had rejected all the figures on the friday then spent the weekend producing a whole lot more with the support of every bank in the country
you are only a bailiff the man who carries out the process of seizing this social market economy which can best be summed up as follows the market is economising on society
the danger with this type of aid is that we create a group of associations receiving preferential treatment which in the end creates an autonomous body with no relationship with the grass roots
as a result the proposal contains too many exceptions and exemptions
did they not brutally force through their positions
we are seeking a lively dialogue and see no intrinsic value in the intergovernmental conference 's being concluded during the autumn
specifically and crucially it does not define how national economic policies should be coordinated or review the objectives of the european central bank so as to link them more actively to growth and employment policies
the views of ' civil society ' were certainly given a hearing but there was never any question of involving the citizens in the drafting process
they are more open to this now that they are being increasingly threatened by china
but whether the current wto can actually deliver those outcomes is frankly much harder to believe
the president cut off the speaker
madam president commissioner i shall not criticise either the commission or the european parliament
imagine also that you want public sector information that you intend to re-use
in judging the conflicting amendments- i as a mere politician have in general put my trust in the commission 's air quality experts
we have concentrated on africa but we also need to get its people on board and allow them to feel that this is their project that they can work on it and achieve good results
it often takes center stage in the house although it has actually been threatened with extinction at times
i have spoken somewhat longer than i would have preferred but given the importance of the case and the tragic stories that surround it i wanted to be crystal clear in my statement to this parliament
thus many of them were ruined we are talking about huge assets while despair led some of them to suicide
i am standing between two highly esteemed british colleagues namely roy perry and michael cashman
he has made his ruling to which i adhere
parliament adopted the text
they get very few answers
one thing that was also missing from your remarks was a reference to the need to have the agreement of the acp to this arrangement
in cologne there is now a center providing training for astronauts
are we in this house not the very people who are up in arms when a populist like haider or schwarzenegger suddenly wins elections
i believe that he deserves particular credit for this
it is understandable that the international community should be focusing its attention on the security issue but we must not forget the need to strengthen institutions and undertake reforms
i am profoundly convinced ladies and gentlemen that the construction of this wall is a very great tragedy
his track record has earned him the support of the house
that coexistence requires effective democracy based on tolerance and freedom we must recognize that such democracy is not yet in place
.
i have supported and voted in favor of this report which acknowledges the efforts made by a number of european states to ensure that europe now has policies concerned with space
mr president could you please pass this message on to the authorities in azerbaijan
above all i feel sorry for those governments who say that they are in favor of higher standards as long as they do not need to adhere to them
i see us today as being able to take a significant step in the right direction
we have to remember however that skills and know-how should not be lured here at the expense of third countries
in fact we are aware that this training is one of the keys to the program 's success and that all of the member states are already working on it
it is the children themselves who suffer
railway safety is good in most cases at the moment and it is imperative that it remain good at least as good as it is now
we have cooperated in an exemplary manner
the common position of the council is 1 january two thousand ninety six for opening up international freight services and 1 january two thousand ninety six for national freight services
following the coreper compromise only eur 61 million have been allocated over four years to fund actions in the fifteen member states
the chapter on internal policies contains another reduction in relation to the commission but an increase in relation to the council in respect of measures to be taken in connection with the ever increasing marine pollution
mr mulder you have convinced the commission of the soundness of your proposals
we believe eur 5 million per accident for personal injury and eur 2 million for property damage would be more appropriate and flexible and could be a compromise position
we are very much looking forward to the document that will eventually be on the table
international indifference on this issue is embarrassing
furthermore this insurance cover would overlap with the voluntary insurance regulated in directive 87 344 eec on legal expenses insurance
nor was there substantive progress on economic reform
how much will is there to change the course of the current trend of globalisation
secondly what upsets the previous speakers is something that i personally find reassuring
i believe mr president that this is an aspect of the problem which should not be avoided
i would encourage you then in future to conclude repatriation agreements not only with states like macao but also in fact with the states from which we can expect the most migrants
the american attitude towards the control of biological and chemical weapons the test ban treaty and their threat to withdraw from the outer space treaty make this a very live issue
but i would stress to all members that parliament has already urged member states to stick as close to the convention draft as possible and perhaps that discipline should apply to this house in making further demands now
surely this is a mistake as we are investing in infrastructure that is essential for economic growth to create a stronger economy and a stable growth environment
if they were implemented immediately they would bring instant peace to the long-suffering people of israel and palestine
this support for the victim must involve two types of measures which complement each other
as others have said this legislation seeks not just to help anyone who might be unfortunate enough to be a victim of such a crime but to try to ensure that there is consistency
i suppose it is a start though
recovery plans are very delicate and serious issues which must be approached with recourse to the greatest possible scientific knowledge and with the greatest possible support from the sector involved as well given their significant socio-economic impact
they must be replaced by policies which do the reverse responding effectively to the needs of the workers and people of bolivia and improving their living conditions
there are sufficient individual examples of this in the european union but there is too little structure
for years this sector had a system of sustainable fishing which earned the praise of many
we talk in terms of armies parties or refugees but these are as a rule ethnic groups appearing in the guise of an army a party or as refugees
i could name groups in a number of member states for whom discrimination is similarly prevalent just to put the record straight
i can go into further detail if you so wish
after that the time comes for them to decide
this cannot be allowed to go ahead and every effort must be made to ensure that it is prevented
i fail to find this spelled out clearly in the commission proposal and nor does it contain other objectives such as education health care environment and democratisation
in asia certain countries have made progress in terms of consolidating their democracies and their development has been given momentum
that is the problem
take for example the dyspraxia foundation which was set up in nineteen eighty seven by two english mothers stella white and marion owen
.
in my country it was not so long ago that only one female minister was appointed
we have just recently prepared a new list of parliamentary candidates consisting of ten women and ten men with the vacancies divided on an alternating basis between male and female candidates
yesterday when the progress reports were presented i heard not one word said about the under-representation of women
.
imbalances remain between men and women in the field of training and employment in the new ict and i therefore voted in favor of the report
i have just returned from washington as an ad hoc member of the us delegation
to the extent that we are the custodians of the public interest in such a crucial area we must act with extreme care and reflect and respect the views of our citizens
of course ethical principles and technical safety measures have to be complied with but now ladies and gentlemen it is a question of cells that will be destroyed in any case
the commission would strongly support a vote in favor of these reports
i am also interested in making our citizens feel safer and of course i am also interested in the internal market
does it need to be extended with effective territorial coverage for mobile phones with access for everyone to a fast internet connection
i will therefore make every effort to concentrate more specifically on thanking all those who told us beforehand what they were doing so that we could clearly follow the amendments that were being prepared
it would be shortsighted to try to attain the kyoto targets at the expense of those who create employment if no previous attempt had been made to exploit all the opportunities which transport affords for reducing emissions
president prodi you said you had learned a number of lessons from the eurostat affair but your text fails to mention one that is genuinely important the commission must pay greater heed to parliament
let us not say that parliament is suddenly completely in the clear over this
alternatively the information should be placed before the judicial authorities
obviously rejection goes further than any amendments to a text that the majority of the committee on economic and monetary affairs proposes to reject
there is no plenary amendment today to reject the commission proposal
this is a crucial addition since human papilloma virus kills 12 800 women every year in europe
much has already been said about the management board and also about the voting rights
and in this regard we will support the commission
however it has to be clearly assumed that that is something for the future
clearly things would be different if each national parliament considered separately or each population by means of a referendum had the formal right to opposition
only in this way can we avoid seeing the number of producers leaving the sector increase
this is clearly a very sensitive issue
there are hardly any really independent large media left
the italian word for what is essentially going on in chechnya is not but
as a direct consequence of this situation together with the pitiful living conditions endured by the majority of the people there we are forced to confront increasing illegal immigration and the danger of terrorist attacks
i am also delighted that commissioner verheugen has taken over the wider europe dossier because i am convinced that he will oversee it just as successfully as he did enlargement itself
the next item is question time b5-0414 two thousand fifty one
europe minister mr buttiglioni is one of the members of the italian government most committed to having the preamble to the constitution specify the religious cultural and historical heritage
a series of proposals will be examined and we will try to ensure that these problems do not arise in the future
we want to find ways of working together more systematically in the field of security and foreign policy so that we can be more effective in carrying forward those policies where our objectives coincide
the second report concerns the issue of citizenship to which i have already referred
unfortunately however it did not take that principle to its logical conclusion because the draft presented to us still reserves privileges for the ewl in the new framework
we cannot allow a europe where some are more equal than others
now i hope that the contributions provided for by the programs for women will be distributed in a democratic way not in the way that was so clearly criticised by mrs kratsa- tsagaropoulou and other speakers before me
.
we believe there are some 107 casualties it is known that there are 7 dead so far and 4 british diplomats are missing
last week in fact three ministers were sacked the parliament was suspended and a state of emergency was declared
the sri lankan people are suffering and have suffered a great deal as a result of the terrorist acts carried out in their country and the climate of insecurity to which these have led
i can certainly see the direct and straightforward arguments for setting such tests
then we have to give a common response to the international challenges related to security freedom and justice
i feel that it is only right that the presidency the commission and everyone involved should try to reach agreement in brussels
eu leaders are now meeting next week on 12 december two thousand seventy five to see whether they can hammer out the final agreement which will govern the future of the european union
while the italian government 's timetable is certainly ambitious it can be achieved under the right circumstances
the support given to this plan by parliament was decisive and now the plan must be implemented
germany and france overstepped the mark in the way they interpreted the rules and what was a community matter they made merely intergovernmental
the stability pact never describes how to play the game and the game can only be a team game
he condemns the situation in the concentration camps and the situation of the detainees which are precisely the issues on which we would like to hear him and to be able to discuss with him
that is why it is important for regional authorities to have their own voice and to be given this in the legislative process
the commission should adopt a more active policy in this regard
is the commission thinking about starting with this
there was even greater difficulty in agreeing some form of common format with regard to a design for a coin or for a bank note when the euro came into being
secularism is an essential value for french people and it is an intrinsic part of our culture
i am glad the commission has recognized that in terms of the amendments it has accepted from parliament
overall however this is clearly a modest measure
let me start by saying that the proposal that the commission has put forward is a serious attempt at resolving this problem but that at the same time it is true that good things can still be improved
this time public opinion in all our countries is likely to suffer a serious crisis of confidence in a united europe
thanks to the leadership of mrs de palacio vice-president of the commission as well as the danish greek and italian presidencies we are now in a position to sign a draft interinstitutional agreement today
only a ban on mass redundancies could protect workers from the tragic consequences of takeover bids for jobs
cooperation with the italian presidency has also been very successful for which my thanks
we ourselves in fact suggested placing some of the money for kedo in reserve when north korea failed to adhere to all the conditions of this nuclear energy program
we want the funds to be spent on the purposes for which they are intended which is why we exercise control over spending firstly through the committee on budgetary control but also at the financing planning stage
third the environmental aspects
we have heard from certain colleagues particularly in the uk that is also the case there
we need simple basic regulation to protect the consumer because there are as mrs stihler has said products that purport to contain herbal remedies that do not actually contain those herbals
to this end we have consistently followed and actively supported all the steps that have led to the current proposal now under discussion in the council
one thing that this means is that we want to adopt a basic resolution to the effect that the same provisions apply to all members of this house since we all do the same work
the parallels with the events of ten years ago on the eve of the genocide in rwanda are alarmingly great
it is in fact the code of conduct which applies in this issue
quite by chance i met with the representatives of the german minority in poland in wroclaw only a few days ago
the other is better cooperation in the field of police and justice
thank you very much for your cooperation with parliament this evening mrs de palacio
fifteen per cent of all boys and 21 of all girls do not go to school
we certainly have different views on the continued existence or otherwise of genetically modified organisms but we wish to be cautious
the old generation of these agreements however really deserves a black mark and it is thus extremely important to change this situation
the two issues must be kept separate
if six years ago we had offered georgia the chance to join it would undoubtedly be in the same situation as the countries that are soon to join the eu
after all this is about an international world standard and we will need to maintain very high standards
everything hinges of course on inspections and on the way in which we catch the polluters in the act
responsibilities are clearly indicated and unambiguous sanctions are imposed in the event of non-compliance
the commission will work with a will to deal with these complex issues
thank you for your kind words mr president
it also concerns the candidate countries and potentially russia too in certain cases
i will now say a word on the state of play in the wto in particular since work resumed on 15 december
the question that commissioner lamy asked us was whether we would give him free rein to enter into the negotiations with the package as he proposed it
it should be noted in this context that measures are included to provide both legal and material assistance to victims of trafficking
we would be better advised to encourage closer cooperation between member states which would in turn foster greater interoperability and compatibility of the resources available at intra-european level and would avoid wasteful duplication and overlapping
nevertheless it appears mr lamy that in your meeting with the g20 countries held in brasilia the european union would have accepted the demand to define the criteria relating to the green box in a more restrictive manner
we are in favor of liberalising trade subject to certain standards and rules and it is clear that the singapore issues will force the world trade organization to lay down a number of rules
however their ' dolphin safe ' label is not turtle safe or shark safe
i would also like to thank him for taking on board many of the verts ale group 's suggestions
we can only support sustainable and responsible fishing
it will also take into account the principles of sustainable or environmentally friendly development set out in the gothenburg strategy
in sub-saharan africa treatment is offered to only one per cent of the four million people who need it
i should like to highlight one point that deserves specific attention namely the special position of women
numerous political contacts to date between the european commission and the african union commission have been preparing the ground for launching a strategic structured dialogue between the two bodies
madam president the list of objectives for nepad is very long it includes many different concepts such as conflict prevention democracy and regional economic integration
it is time to stop pretending
you said just now mr president-in-office of the council that we were the elected representatives of the people
mr president mr president-in-office of the council i would like to begin by congratulating the commission on fulfilling its responsibility with regard to judicially demanding compliance with the stability pact
the fact that the convention succeeded in drawing up a constitutional text that was also widely supported by this parliament shows that political and geographical differences are not an insurmountable obstacle
finally we must guarantee the subsidiarity under which local or territorial powers are exercised
.
does it have anything to do with lebanon and the objectives of the european union through the agreement with lebanon
no-one seems to be clear what this means
the countries with the most serious structural problems such as greece and portugal have the lowest employment rates in services
but at this stage i want to say equally clearly that there is a need for legal legislative or contractual controls in order to avoid abuses that result in precariousness such as exists in the us system
we had a mass of amendments to vote on
of course the precondition to the success of such an endeavor is recognition of university diplomas
this clearly damages the eu as a whole and leads to greater risks for more vulnerable investors
as mr purvis said in the short term it would be appropriate to find incentives to attract offshore funds onshore
the effect of the policy of toleration and the naturalizations whether or not collective in several member states is to attract more foreigners to live there illegally
- b5-0033 two thousand ninety six by bastiaan belder on behalf of the edd group on zimbabwe
with regard to follow up on the green paper there still needs to be a debate within the commission on the nature of the proposal to be put forward
the fact that for example weapons exist which are capable of destroying the whole world does not mean that we will allow them to be used
it is clear that our common starting point is the belief that the un system is the key to safeguarding international security in the largest sense of that term
the proposal that the presidency inform the parliament of the content of the eu priorities for each un general assembly session seems an excellent idea and the council will act on this
although the analysis of the commission proposal carried out by the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy led to only one amendment the proposal is of enormous importance in the field of plant genetics
by mobilising their forces and working with conviction they had the principle of the non-separation of technical services accepted and ensured that the states retained responsibility for the functional blocks of airspace
it would be sensible to think about measures to tackle this issue and we clearly agree with mr katiforis on this
it is very important that we do that on health and come forward with proposals
not to mention such other things as for example the people who then think they too can use this for their own purposes by contrary to what the directive intended creating more difficulties
they also want sound information which states that since you normally do not eat raw meat chicken meat in a different composition or other method of preparation can do no harm
as we are aware there is an eu communicable diseases network which has been in existence since nineteen ninety nine
i would like to make one final fundamental observation before moving on to the specific aspects of the proposal
the work we have carried out is wide-ranging but absolutely essential
some countries are blocking it and i will name them they are the united kingdom and the netherlands
the eligibility dates of the expenditure for the various sub-projects are 29 december two thousand eighty eight and 1 january two thousand eighty eight respectively
this situation is unacceptable
under the forum seven working groups are active on priority esafety topics
it is inexplicable to me to suggest that scottish and irish salmon but not other farmed salmon fed on exactly the same feed somehow did not come out of this study as measuring up to the same standards
in general i feel it is important not to convey a negative impression of progress to date
it is of the utmost importance that the commission should propose measures in order to alleviate this particularly painful shortcoming
when we discuss asylum and migration on behalf of the commission i would like to stress that all our proposals were totally in line with the goals decided upon by the heads of state and government in tampere
the crucial priority is to get back to political negotiations
so what is the point of working towards a common foreign and security policy if when it comes to the most important questions we just say that we do not have a view
rather than get involved in a big statistical debate the point can and should be made that poverty and pockets of poverty will be found in any society irrespective of how affluent it is
mr president mr president-in-office of the council i too am dissatisfied with your answer as i have heard accounts from relatives of cuban citizens unjustly held in us prisons who have been denied any visiting rights
i certainly reject the suggestion that the european union and certainly this presidency is in any way equivocal on matters relating to human rights
indeed they merely involve the exchange of methodology and data which i see as insufficiently pro-active
1
it contains absolutely everything we may wish to find and so it is a pleasure to read and support it
madam president i wish to begin by congratulating mr brie on his excellent report
everybody knows that ben ali is going to use this not inconsiderable sum to fund his presidential propaganda
commissioner bolkestein who launched two sets of infringement proceedings against the uk government over the regulation of lloyd 's regularly tells us that his responsibility is only to bring a member state into compliance
the commission is very good at providing humanitarian assistance via echo and this is an instance in which we should move as fast as we can
the first is to guarantee continuity
these are the priorities we propose
there is discussion of the growth measures associated with the policy and strategy for growth
our presidency approach to the issue of employment is informed by the recommendations of the employment task force chaired by mr wim kok which reported to the european commission at the end of two thousand seventy seven
let me finish by emphasising the importance of the sixth environment action program which should help us to implement the kyoto protocol
it must be a guarantee of high-quality public services
these factors are all crucial in my view
the european union must modernize the operation of our labor markets
furthermore i am genuinely curious to see the report of the general secretaries of the institutions on the estimates of the administrative needs for two thousand ninety nine
from an ecological point of view it is quite irresponsible to proceed in this way
european jargon can be used to paint a glowing picture of a brighter future but it cannot hide the hard truth
this is an extremely serious matter
it is time for the eu to get tough on counterfeiting and piracy
it is essential to raise this issue but in a sensible manner
the next item is the joint debate on the following four oral questions to the commission on achieving the correct implementation of the ec israel association agreement
mr president under the terms of the eu-israel association agreement that agreement applies solely to the territory of the state of israel
we set great store by a clear explanation of these problems by the commission
if you really want to help victims of trafficking and exploitation you should not hide behind the interests of european law enforcement authorities and fob victims off with short-term residence permits
.
the second point is the establishment of a support center for ngos so that they may be able to improve their projects set up links with other partners and enjoy the benefits of the daphne acquis
what is at issue here moreover is the scope of the directive which is intended to cover breaches of copyright
whether or not we had a qualified majority was not at issue today
the house is very keen to have answers to a number of questions
let it be clear i am in favor of carrying on of giving the reforms and reformers my warm support
croatia has been on the right path for years
it has been proposed that the action programs be harmonised as regards the long-fought-for share of cofinance the principle of degressivity and their duration
we used to get 0.8 if we want improved performance and higher quality that will have to be paid for somehow
.
as soon as we resolve the minor matters of the weighting of votes it will come into force i am sure
looked at from that angle what we are debating is very definitely a fair offer
as the author is not present question no 41 lapses
however this does not mean that we should decide now on non-binding target values
your final objective is actually complete decoupling
it is obvious that all of this cannot be achieved overnight
but these must also and will need to be pursued most vigorously in the coming months and years
the commission is bound to do so as guardian of the treaties and we will judge you by that yardstick
everyone knows that but hardly anyone dares say so out loud
.
in the past the european parliament has very successfully asked for scientific cooperation to be frozen
we are also adapting it to take due account of the decisions of the court of justice
governments too have now realized how important it actually is to organise a structured exchange of information both in the health sector and in the sphere of care for the elderly
even when they are in need of care most people want to stay in their own homes
it needs to be added however that there are many other problems that are just as serious
on 1 may ten new member states will join the eu under the accession treaty which was signed on 16 april two thousand ninety four in athens
.
then we need to help with bringing the guilty to justice and the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission
by next month 29 april two thousand ninety nine the european union common position must be revised
last week i was in austria where there is considerable political pressure for it too to abandon its cherished neutrality and join nato
there is therefore a real risk that the united states will leave the negotiating table and not return
it was extremely arrogant to say the least
the us undertakings contain a clear commitment in that regard
i hope that this will not happen when it comes to the vote and that we will approve this report
the third is the need for mechanisms to ensure that the principle of equality is applied on the ground
.
we feel that what is at stake is the concept of cooperation and we would therefore like to go further as advocated in the opinions of the committee on development and cooperation
i do not know whether i will be able to take care of these statistics regulations after the 13 june elections they are much drier than wine and honey
the commission proposes a set of rules that the member states must adhere to when negotiating and implementing air service agreements for this category of joint agreements requiring the participation of member state governments
we see no reason not to endorse this conclusion and therefore voted in favor
.
if the kosovars themselves are unable to keep their own extremists under control there is no hope of fulfilling the most important condition for independence which is respect for minorities
in fact there are a number of applications where no alternative is possible for example fire protection and the use of sulphur hexafluoride in switch gear
it was the third priority of this environmental program and at the time it was said that it was a very important component in the new challenges that lay ahead of us
if this convention is to be effective however it must bear the stamp of modernity and set in motion greater participation among all those who contribute to improving the environment in europe
mr president i should like to thank mr manders
consequently our national legislation has been particularly strict and strong with regard to mining waste
we focused on the key issues where action is crucial if we are to re-inject momentum into the lisbon agenda
this puts the european union in a new position
on the constitution mr watson and mr duff 's party leader in the uk has joined my party in calling for a uk referendum on a constitution
it is also important to look to the future and encourage research into more sustainable production that produces less waste
at the same time we would state that we require better levels of cooperation from croatia with the hague court than hitherto
it could be considered an example for other countries wishing to join the eu and be held up as exemplary in terms of a new intake and new opening between majority populations and minorities of any kind
firstly we must combat this crime wherever it occurs
the debate is closed
one particular deficiency in the road transport sector is in social regulations one good example being those on driving and rest times in the training of drivers and especially again in safety
surely not
i would appeal to the commission in these circumstances to think again
.
mr president waste is a major problem throughout the european union
the bonn conference will be the first step
i would appeal as i did last month to those who have evidence of any wrongdoings to provide me with evidence to release me to do my duty before this house its members and the european public
this is a completely unfounded allegation
the agreement leaves the protection afforded by the directive unchanged in particular the proportionality requirement and the need for personal data to be processed fairly and lawfully
consumer purchases represent close to 60 of the eu 's gdp
we hope we can get support for them because they would improve the overall end result
i know that the issue of non-audit services delivered to the audited entity is particularly delicate
i agree with you commissioner when you say that self-regulation has demonstrated its limitations
this is because it lays down the minimum requirements for the key aspect of the approach to liberalisation of the energy market namely access to the networks for third parties
i could mention the gas and electricity liberalisation packages
the commission can accept the following amendments subject to rewording 2 3 4 43 74 and 75

ladies and gentlemen i must now make the following point with regard to the agenda
the croatian economy is already very strongly intermeshed with the economy of the european union and is clearly outperforming the economies of bulgaria and romania for example whose accession is envisaged for two thousand ninety three
so while understanding the philosophy behind the question the commission wants to be certain that it is absolutely necessary to pass this into legislation
indeed a number of member states are at the same time attempting to restrict private gambling service providers while vigorously promoting participation in games of chance via monopolies or licensees of the state
i would like to stress again that it is not totally correct to talk about limiting cultural cooperation or limiting cultural activities
the cooperation between france and germany started with cooperation in the field of the two large industrial sectors of the time coal and steel and was later expanded to economic cooperation and a european agricultural policy
there is also a paragraph on relations with local residents

to close i must say that above all the luxembourg presidency had the courage to go ahead with the referenda in these difficult times
it also underlines the importance of participation by civil society and mobilisation of the private sector
a further characteristic feature of the situation in belarus is the fact that the state is the only internet provider as there are no other operators in the country with access to external telecommunications services
speaking of disasters for scotland your own line on the eu budget limit would end structural funding in scotland at a cost of a billion pounds
.
far too many users are still falling prey to e-mailshots that trick them into disclosing their bank details thus credulously giving fraudsters access not only to sensitive data but also to their own bank accounts
however some of my colleagues feel this is the wrong judgement
despite growth and fiercer competition however much ecoindustry potential remains unrealised
the power cuts in recent years have clearly shown how vulnerable we are
why should we not provide a framework for such activities in the shape of an independent coordination center for the eu as a whole
in principle therefore this directive aims to improve and shore up article 52 of the munich convention
the lisbon strategy on the european economic model combines together technological innovations competitiveness and solidarity
i want to focus briefly on two key issues of this directive firstly the definition of what we propose to allow patents on
i believe that it is up to each member state to decide whether it wishes to have an information and communication strategy or campaigns for the euro and economic and monetary union
this is also happening in eu member states
today the european parliament has adopted a report that presents proposals concerning a variety of efforts to combat child labor
the new regulation gives public authorities at all levels the opportunity to establish a new instrument on the territory of one of the chosen countries
it is worth stressing that even though this regulation does not contain any decisions relating to financial matters it is part of a package on cohesion policy
as tony blair said to you less than two weeks ago we fully recognize the importance of reaching an agreement on the budget and we will make as much progress as possible during our presidency
my thanks also to mr galeote quecedo who has steered the work of the committee on regional development so efficiently
mr president there is a set of very sensitive issues in the debates on structural and cohesion funds leading to conflicts of opinion that go beyond the political groups
at present this relates above all to the new member states
this is a momentous development hidden away as usual behind dry jargon
numerous examples can be found to show that companies from the 15 old member states win tenders to invest in the new member states
mere incentives and recommendations will not be enough to achieve equality of pay in the future either
a variety of tools are employed to this end including technical measures legal clarifications and provisions that will give fresh political impetus to the promotion of equality between men and women for example with regard to equal pay
finally with reference to traffic accidents i should like to congratulate mrs wallis once again on having thoroughly studied this issue which is of great practical importance for citizens
i hope that the results will be excellent
we need a vision that is worthy of a community comprising 25 member states
many countries that are poor in economic terms but rich in wisdom could give us much inspiration
it is an important cultural factor
.
we also consider the amounts earmarked for this fund for two thousand eighty nine to two thousand eighty nine to be inadequate particularly in light of the eu enlargement
this will require enormous resources
there is an opportunity as the g8 begins its deliberations today in scotland to make real progress on africa and climate change
reconciliation is a very painful process after a devastating war like this after violations of the most fundamental human rights but it is also a necessary process
for example it is a member of the world trade organization it participates in economic cooperation within apec and is a member of other international organizations
the second issue is no less important and has to do with farmers on this border
this compromise is based on the idea of not pre-empting the results of the impact assessment currently being conducted by the european commission
.
so encouragingly there are serious efforts to keep the preparations moving on and to limit as far as possible the interruption caused by the elections
this is a good thing we cannot deny it but we are not convinced of the usefulness of delegating environmental policies to the member states
we are aware that the fund for rural development and the structural funds are not going to meet all of these needs
this program will need to be in a position to finance other actions such as natura two thousand ninety two which no other program can cover
within five days 7 000 men and boys were brutally murdered
.
the commission is not inclined to modify its proposal concerning these financial ceilings
his government has been responsible for destroying the homes and livelihoods of as many as 1.5 million zimbabweans
they definitely must be applied
i have been talking along with other colleagues today to members of the political opposition in many countries in africa
finally the european union must demand that the government fulfil its responsibility to guarantee the security of the citizens and of the new parliament
with regard to the events of 7 and 8 june it would be desirable if the government were to authorise an independent inquiry in order fully to establish the facts and the charges
of course the situation is a delicate one
the commission considers that many of the changes adopted in the common position improve its initial proposal
needless to say the federal government still in office in germany has gone along with it
excuse me but that is really not good enough
i thank you for your support
the commission will therefore pursue clarification of the united nations no-fly list in talks with the united states as i promised earlier in the summer
the commission is in the process of seeking to elucidate further with the american authorities on that criterion in order to prevent in the future cases of false positives
i do not think that your reply is satisfactory
.
it creates only a small administrative burden and is compatible with existing patent law
this regulation can show our fellow citizens just how useful it is
turning to the paragraph in article 36 that has provoked such debate it is my opinion that a three-month extension of patent protection is adequate for the time being
the prolongation of a patent by six months is yet another gift to the pharmaceutical multinationals in total disregard of the health of children and running counter to the objectives of this very regulation
the rapporteur has to understand that the extra price of the extension period would be paid by the most vulnerable strata of society the poor and their children
the second line of action is protection
the terror threat is not new nor does it recur in the same way each time
how do we protect ourselves when our own fellow citizens including respected neighbors and popular family men are suddenly turned into ruthless death machines
i fully support the approach and the priorities suggested to us today by mr clarke on behalf of the british presidency
i call on you to take note of this and to take immediate measures
i believe it has much to commend it
since then however new developments have taken place such as the increase in travel in new technologies in life expectancy and in incomes all of which favor tourism amongst senior citizens
as i have already said we shall make use of all the non-legislative means we have at our disposal to promote policy in these sectors
a flourishing eu needs a flourishing baltic region and the region needs the eu in order to be able to solve a range of problems environmental as well as social and economic
the eu should not however conduct a common policy on tourism as proposed in the report
next time we are discussing measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions let us remember marginal lands and famine in africa
it will be difficult to rise to it without more substantial development aid from the entire international community
however i believe that it will be in the interests of the people of syria and their rights for the european union to sign and ratify the association agreement
in it the state authorities agreed to the 21 demands made by the strikers
unfortunately this chamber devotes little or no attention to institutional competition
it therefore asked parliament to consider the implications of such a sunset clause carefully
i do not believe it is right to sulk about whether the european parliament was listened to or not
the system must also respect human rights
clearly however under the agreement a wine will have to be aged in oak barrels before the term ' barrel-aged ' could be used on the label
the whole of europe has an incredible amount of wealth which is often to be found out in the regions or city suburbs
it can be seen from those data that there are great disparities in the size of payments for farmers in many of our member states
i will mention again an example from the baltic states
what is more there is barely a murmur about projects which have a real chance of improving european transport such as the lyon-turin link being blocked
the conditions set in the december european council conclusions have been met
let there be no doubt about this
there have been wrongs on both sides and no justice is served by the pretence that the turks alone carry the blame
i have to say that i fail to see either why it is that some apparently find that impossible to swallow or why this whole scheme of things is again being called into question
there are those who would overlook these and many other shortcomings on turkey 's part not least by saying that they are ' road accidents '
pursuant to rule 170 4 of the rules of procedure i would like on behalf of my group to move that we defer our agreement to the additional protocol on customs union
.' they shall transport the bicycle of the passenger in all trains including cross-border and high-speed trains possibly on payment of a charge '
is progress being made
there is no shortage of examples and the war in iraq is one of the most visible
the millennium challenge is enormous and it will take a functional un to meet it
the peacebuilding commission was given a lot of scope
i thank the president-in-office for his reply
.
india and the eu are also predestined to cooperate on the environment agriculture human rights in meeting the millennium goals and in the fight against poverty
the subject of biomass was very important to us and i am pleased that we succeeded in voting in a whole chapter
for example we feel that the target of 25 by two thousand ninety five presents problems and have tabled amendments on this
the recent opinion simply emphasises this
i am delighted that the report mentions vulnerable road users and that the aim is to have no accidents at all
we are seeing these key standards that have been fought over for very many years now being rolled back in the name of trying to be ever more competitive
the eu has a strong global export profile in high-quality and high-tech products and services which now account for about half of european exports and a third of world demand
to echo mr caspary there are a whole series of human rights and other problems
it is the result of an open unprotected market economy with free competition
european companies are entitled to have their intellectual property protected in law but certainly also in practice and are also entitled to access to the chinese markets
this represents a great opportunity for farmers who may gradually change from being food producers to energy producers
the eplp therefore cannot support harmonization of blood alcohol levels and speed limits at this time
mr president i am happy to say that the scope of the debate which we are just concluding has gone much further than trade relations
it would also increase the trust placed by citizens in the state
the next item is the vote on the motions for resolutions on violations of human rights democracy and the rule of law
mr president this morning and this summer has seen an unprecedented level of irregular migration across the mediterranean into the european union
addressing the symptoms alone is no sort of solution we also have to face up to the underlying causes
all this however is being swept under the carpet
today the eu donates 60 of the total amount of aid to africa
madam president i would like to emphasise that i am speaking on my own behalf
this followed an appeal by a british prisoner that his human rights were being violated by the english law that prevents prisoners from voting
this is not a problem just for spain and morocco and nor must it be seen purely from the perspective of controlling illegal migration
i should like to qualify what i have heard here
in addition reducing the number of young people who leave school early and widening access to higher education are fundamental objectives which should be achieved by two thousand ninety seven
the assessment should rely on the standards and procedures adopted at bergen although these should not be regarded as static and unchangeable
these children should be provided as much as possible with flexible learning settings
their strong family life is their fortune
we have seen studies showing the risks involved in driftnets and i think that the studies no doubt justify applying the precautionary principle in this case
mr president recently the president of the french republic was attributing to europe responsibilities which legally speaking it does not have given that the matter in hand related to redundancies on french soil
this means that further fragmentation will not result in a higher success rate but we do want to achieve higher rates in the case of bilateral and trilateral dimensions and projects
we also have to support the indirect costs linked to the private funding of production projects
however the commission cannot accept amendment 12 which provides a new definition of placing on the market
but we must have rules and institutions that are able to govern the globalisation process
the decision has not yet been taken
for this reason we are subject to considerable pressure from migration flows as indeed we shall continue to be in future
national competences of course remain unaffected
when deciding on how to back this project the european union chose the more expensive option since the agreements previously concluded with russia provided for a cheaper solution namely a second leg for the yamal pipeline
furthermore it seems to me that the spending adjustment variable is what are being called projects of common interest which are not priority projects
these are amendments 19 and 20
the potential impact on the internal market for this equipment of a delay in amending the legislation must not be overlooked
i regret to say that my speaking time is up
this is a major area for the whole development of healthcare and for business in the future
.
in considering the health section of the 7th framework program for research and development will the council consider the relevance of different types of health issues to the lisbon agenda
in the light of this it is only natural to review and debate the barcelona process
there are no clear improvements in this field or in democracy freedom and transparency
problems relating to illegal immigration respect for human rights equal rights for women the advancement of democracy and the economic development of the countries around the mediterranean basin have become our problems too
there are other countries where i am somewhat disappointed and where we need to work together
naturally i am sensitive to the problem of the 3 500 jobs that depend on tobacco production in portugal
in this regard i support all of the financial backing that can be given to them on the part of community or national institutions
furthermore steps must be taken to improve safety at work an issue that is as important in spain as it is in other eu countries so that tragedies of this nature can be prevented in the future
mr labouani is a symbolic figure in syria
we are not seeing many such ideas bubbling up so far
this matter needs to be taken up at a political level in order to ensure that the legal guarantees that the eu is meant to offer are fully respected
yet if we are to do that without a constitution we need a policy initiative bringing together the council the commission and parliament so that the measures required for the european institutions to operate can be made effective
we are all agreed on this but when it comes to how this improvement is to be carried out opinion in this house is very much divided
reach is a significant improvement on the status quo
the debate is closed
development projects affecting countries regions or areas are perfectly eligible
i noticed that the words of mrs muscardini provoked the mirth of certain members whereas they should rather be given serious consideration
that was instrumental in mobilising international support from over 80 countries and organizations for the iraqi transitional government and for the institutions for the transitional period before the december elections
we also want to set up joint working groups in areas of common interest such as trade and energy
we are therefore in this for the long run and will have to remain in iraq for a long time in order to restore stability to that country
instead we must lower the ceiling step by step
scientists have claimed that water temperatures in the north atlantic and the gulf of mexico have been as much as 3.6 degrees higher than normal this year
i would also like to congratulate mrs beckett on her commitment to climate policy
i support many of the guidelines on environmental policy that europe has been pursuing reflected in both the report and the commission communication
france has said no and the united kingdom is being asked to relaunch europe
it is not only tony blair whose absence we regret but i do wonder whether he had perhaps recognized at last that there is more to a successful presidency of the council than two good speeches
mr davies who has now left the chamber again emphasised the importance of future financing
in denmark we have large fox farms and these are dreadful too no matter what type of trapping is practiced
constitutional restrictions remain however
commissioner the european code on arms exports has a number of shortcomings the most glaring of which is the fact that it is not legally binding
africa is also the continent that offers us the greatest opportunity today
we need to do all we can to widen access to generic aids drugs
great progress has recently been made in spain on a vaccine against malaria but at the moment bill gates and other private foundations are putting a great deal more money into this than international bodies
mr president we are now going to debate what for parliament is a unique report
mr president if the eu is able to draw inspiration from an approach of this kind i think its existential crisis will begin to look like a bad memory
in the rush to secure a wto deal i trust that this basic obligation is not being either jeopardised or compromised
i know from my own position as a uk minister that there is a great deal of parliamentary and public concern about human rights in cambodia laos and vietnam
i believe that the olympic truce is more than a mere call for an interruption of conflicts
that pandemic killed approximately 50 million people
it moves the eu beyond the current stalemate at the wto regarding the granting of ' compulsory licences ' to pharmaceutical products to combat diseases which afflict millions of people in the developing world
the community must therefore channel its efforts into research and into making funds available for the purpose of developing and obtaining oral vaccines effective in all relevant bird species to combat various strains
mr president i simply wished to point out that four weeks ago we spoke in this house about the bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor imprisoned in libya
it is time to dump nickel cadmium and time to vote in favor of amendment 54
this situation is aggravated by the fact that manufacturers and distributors prefer to pay a product fee rather than to take steps to collect and recycle batteries
in two thousand ninety one the country boasted an 89.5 recycling rate
parliament is again trying to increase its own power at the expense of the member states
that could be done through clear transparent and correct information
no one is entirely satisfied each of us has made a sacrifice and modified our positions
in this way the eu will increase its powers even though the member states have not legally bestowed them
if you have taken this lesson to heart then i will be very satisfied with the british presidency of the council
we need europe so that we can carry out a common foreign and security policy which is distinct from those of the self-contained empires throughout the world
it is therefore unclear why the rapporteur ultimately ruled out this
i hope that the council and the commission can step up their protests against the dictator in havana who continues to mock the whole world
under its action plan tunisia has signed up to commitments in the area of democracy good governance and human rights
the european union wishes to see tunisia maintain and develop its security and its prosperity
special attention has been devoted to problems in boarding and alighting from trains and to obligations relating to evacuation in emergencies
that project is part of the overall framework in support of an anti-discrimination framework in serbia and montenegro and will be carried out under the cards two thousand eighty four program for the state union
there are stretches of our network in which within little more than twenty-five kilometres there are five motorway toll stations which inevitably increases congestion
one of you spoke of a compromise but it is a compromise that may be considered a commitment
as far as i can see the little people everywhere are not getting very much at all from the cap at the moment
they all know that if the eu and its scrooges are the answer it must have been a stupid question
this approach would consist of looking at immigration from the angle of prosperity solidarity and security within the european union and of doing so in close cooperation with the third countries concerned
i am addressing the president of the commission when i say that we very much appreciate his writing to the british presidency on 12 december and that we endorse what he had to say in that letter
the film of the british presidency however is a horror film that will end in disaster
yes mr schulz you are right not just listened to in silence but listened to carefully just as carefully as i have listened to all of you ladies and gentlemen
following the vote on the alvaro report i believe that labor meps were successful in getting stronger safeguards concerning the security of communication data and in specifying penal and administrative sanctions for abusive use of retained data
this is a difficult issue on which to adopt a position
i have been back to bulgaria since then as indeed has the president of parliament
i would like to call attention to the importance of the following amendment proposals accepted by the committee on foreign affairs
is the council now prepared to consider proposals for reform which happen to be included within the eu constitutional treaty
everyone must be on an equal footing within europe
unless of course members of this house have drafted a motion for a resolution condemning media monopolies in eu member states
this also affects ngos delivering humanitarian assistance under the echo program
nevertheless i cannot help but think that this debate is largely a waste of time
another highly significant point is the one about non-european citizens that is third-country nationals who are legally resident in the european union
i therefore hope that the points raised are upheld
.
the laws in europe on paedophilia sex tourism and organised prostitution are in fact so diverse that we really need to show courage and determination in order to reach a consensus
they learn to adopt a consumer lifestyle in which the only goal or motivation to act is economic gain
it is mainly women and children who are by various false pretences recruited into it thereafter being exploited in slavish dependence
let me repeat my view we need to be tougher on the customers
we are now at the stage of evaluating what happened in hong kong and preparing the recommendations for the future negotiation
finally framework programs for research are under discussion and many members have raised one point that will become important where agriculture is concerned
it underlines the importance which both our institutions ascribe to meeting the challenge of climate change and to the role of the multilateral procedure in the course of doing so
the answer is quite simple
.
otherwise we could end up with distortion of competition and there is also the risk of relocation as a result of which european airline companies would move to states with less clear-cut rules
asia after all is gaining in importance and the shortest route to fly to it is still via the russian federation
the recent energy crisis between russia and ukraine has exposed the vulnerability of many member states of the european union that are to a dangerous extent dependent on one supplier
i made the same request of commissioner ferrero-waldner but nothing unfortunately has as yet been forthcoming
farmers will be forced to intensify their production of sugar beet and to concentrate it in selected countries and regions all for the sake of increased competitiveness
it is a shame of course that the agreement was accepted by the council without having consulted the european parliament which represents the interests of the european people
as i am not the commissioner responsible i can only give my personal view and not that of the commission on this new development which the commission has not had time to discuss
asean leaders also agreed to dispatch the foreign minister of malaysia the current chair of asean to assess the democratic process during a visit
i hope that the compromise is adopted in the end as it will give beet growers planning security and enable sugar-beet production in the eu to continue in future in spite of severe cuts
we must set as our objective the survival of our farmers on their farms
i believe that this may create a huge number of problems above all because as we know sustainable development requires knowledge of the direct resource because not every case is the same
firstly it is crucial that the decision be comprehensive in scope so that projects funded by the european union are also covered by the regulations
i have tabled an amendment along with other colleagues which is the 23rd one on this matter
the degree of protection we have now achieved with this directive is not perfect of course but is an initial step in the right direction
is it financially worthwhile
what is happening at the present time in the dispute over place-name signs in carinthia is grotesque
we could have drafted a clear legal framework for the pilotage services
this is stubbornness verging on a denial of democracy when it becomes clear that the commission is daring to trot out the same proposal already rejected by members of this parliament
in addition very clear clarification on state aid rules is essential in order to guarantee transparent and fair competition between european ports
mr president the constitutional treaty is dead long live the treaty
we know a very great deal and there is no short cut
we cannot allow things to progress in that way
.
we are pleased to note that the tannock report responds to these challenges and it is therefore worthy of support
finally i would like to remind you of the situation in egypt
president abdelaziz bouteflika of algeria was in a hospital in paris and still is as far as i know
it is especially important that small and micro enterprises have recourse to european programs
mr president mr verheugen this evening is the last time that we will be considering the european charter for small enterprises as a separate report
that is why neither you nor any of your predecessors have ever used this atomic bomb and that is all to the good
social pay and professional disparities are always a live issue in france and throughout europe too
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen there is a lot to be done if we want to achieve the lisbon objectives and one thing must be clear we will only get there with women
after all a code of this nature has limits and those limits arise from the integrity of members exercising their mandate
our alternative may be based on seven broad proposals
.
we must not draw premature conclusions on behalf of the citizens of our member states
to come back to palestine we had a very important council meeting on monday and a quartet meeting on monday evening
there is scope for criticism of the lack of progress in certain areas
i would now like to address an issue that is of particular importance to the general public and is also among the priorities for the austrian presidency of the council
they want change both inside and outside palestine together with the peace that is a long time coming
there must be new pressure on both sides of the conflict
mr president i should like to make a point of order under rule 145
mr president it saddens me very much that we have to hold this debate on violence against women since it means that we are talking about an active live issue
on the ground the checks will be more coordinated and more effective
mr president ladies and gentlemen i should like simply to highlight some formal and substantive errors with regard to the translation of the italian text
this is understandable but of little value
we in this plenary rather than discussing whether to vote for or against a motion intended to correct a decision by the conference of presidents are staging a rerun of it
the greek government was told of the problem in march two thousand seventy five but concealed it for eleven months
by contrast the cashman report is to be presented tomorrow on a case on which a decision is pending before the court of justice of the european communities and proceedings are under way before the national courts
human rights and the rule of law must be universally respected by those of all faiths and none
there is an immediate need through the international maritime organization
.
the importance of plurality of the press and a good balance in the provision of information may require longer-term investments of government funds into sectors of that kind
i am not saying that we would not be prepared to raise it
i am being consistent and not saying that we should still do it when it is not necessary
seeing globalisation as a threat feeds calls for protectionism
i would like to recall that until a few years ago the fines imposed were those applying to infringement of the customs legislation and also that smuggling was one of the crimes envisaged by the national law
the preparation of individual directives has been ongoing for the past decade and a half
i have to say however that he produced good work despite rather than because of the help of his own group
what i want to see is more economic probity
we have to enhance the role of our parliament because it is the house of our european representatives
we must live up to our values
mr president the amendment is already in the minutes but i shall read it out again anyway
this report was an opportunity to take a view of what sort of impact globalisation has had on the internal market but sadly this report has missed that opportunity
this would mislead european public opinion
mr president honorable member what europe needs is a coherent energy policy an energy policy that is geared more to our common interests
with this draft the european commission has for the first time ever proposed a law that unlike the community method encourages the disparity in national laws and rewards the least demanding member states
economic growth in the eurozone is practically nil and the economy is developing slowly
in my speech i shall try to add some further questions from the point of view of my group
bosnia and herzegovina is making its way through the stabilisation and association process
the president-in-office spoke of acceptance of responsibility and that will be increasingly in evidence
the council will not turn a blind eye to the continuing violations of human rights and civil liberties and it will continue to give voice to its concerns about the deteriorating conditions in belarus
we have started with support to the radio broadcasting of daily news reports to belarus in both russian and belarusian
repression of the non-state media continues to intensify
thank you for the question
that is why i agree with you totally that our common endeavors are very important for europe to benefit
i would just like to thank you for your answer
mr president the report by mr graefe zu baringdorf discussed here today identifies clearly and concisely the shortcomings and flaws of the risk and crisis management system in european agriculture
it is quite clear that the new member states will not be excluded from risk management measures
the action plan will be based on the overall principles of the european forestry strategy which are sustainability and subsidiarity
i wish however to reassure those who fear such a development
it is ignoring people who hold democracy and human rights dear
then came the resolution of 6 july two thousand ninety nine by our fellow member mr hatzidakis on the reform of the structural funds
in other words ladies and gentlemen we have to understand that climate protection is a crucial factor in reducing the number of weather-related disasters in future
with the exception of austria the figure for workers from the 10 new member states employed has not exceeded 1 of the economically active population
if we unlock the front door at least we will have a say in who we allow in instead of frantically trying to keep illegal entrants away from the back doors
is it not then time to act ladies and gentlemen as the commission is also suggesting
i am also stepping up monitoring activities in the field of media pluralism and will shortly publish a working paper on that issue
their role is therefore socially important and often decisive
it is considerably harder for the institute 's work to change attitudes towards women and to eradicate the discrimination they endure in many european countries
there was a question as to whether it was right for the european union to promote equal opportunities even in its international relations
some member states have made considerable headway with the necessary structural reforms and have what is needed others have yet to make more efforts in that direction
indeed they are and the treaty contains much else that is good and right which should not too readily be surrendered not least in view of the fact that 14 member states have already voted to approve it
this european debate cannot do other than benefit from diversity and creativity but the only thing that will count will be the power of sound argument
it is important to do that
as we have said the european arrest warrant has been an overwhelming success 2 600 warrants have been issued throughout the european union since its creation with the result that judicial procedures have been considerably speeded up
i must point out that i had the opportunity to present this warrant during the era when i was in the council of ministers and unfortunately it was not approved until the 11 september attack happened
certainly economic growth and increased employment are the means by which higher levels of social cohesion will be achieved in conjunction with effective systems of education and training
to sum up the primary victims of restructured workplaces are their workers and suppliers including agricultural producers
citizens need favourable external circumstances in order to do their work and be creative as well as to satisfy their basic needs
the scottish parliament agreed to ask for legal advice on this
when we waste as little time as possible in implementing the four freedoms for all citizens of an eu without borders
the report makes no mention of any particular sum by way of compensation
we are in favor of fishermen and their representative associations being involved in determining measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild depleted stocks amendment 1
how can we best encourage the countries to stick to an ambitious reform agenda
at the same time we are also talking about different countries with different traditions different histories and different degrees of development
thus to avoid eroding our own credibility we cannot take back with the left hand what we gave with the right hand
we need however to change internally and to engage in the debate about enlargement without putting the blame on it
this report does not in any way detract from the rights of candidate countries that have this status at the moment and i should like to make this quite clear
i would like to give a very brief historical overview
those of us from outlying island regions are wondering who is going to pay the additional cost that will arise for these regions in deficit
the legislation has become ineffective as evidenced by unbalanced and economically unsustainable legal decisions in relation to the energy market in portugal and spain
in the current circumstances with key political deadlines ahead in both israel and the palestinian territories it is more important than ever that both parties show restraint and responsibility
this is particularly the case if we assess the impact on sustainability of the euro-mediterranean free trade zone which we want to see up and running by two thousand sixty seven as the commissioner pointed out
i have always felt that with education we can promote the next generation
i therefore welcome all the reforms that have been announced to transform the commission in geneva into a restricted council on human rights
i should explain to mr mulder that edam is a type of cheese that can be produced anywhere
finally there are the internal market rules
it is justified that europe should devote attention to health but europe should only stir into action if there is a clearly added value to be had
against this backdrop the report before us in parliament today broadens these powers and proposes to increase both overall funding and specific funding for measures to be pursued
.
all confirmed the same impression unfortunately the eu has responsibilities in africa and this is why we have adopted this resolution today
unfortunately however the perpetrators of these crimes have rarely been brought to justice and the victims are very frequently denied any form of effective remedy
mr president then i request that the item be placed on the agenda of the next conference of presidents
so what are the next steps
it seems to me particularly important to say that we are convinced that a well-designed environment policy will have a positive effect on growth and employment
how many are there and which are they
will we submit a single unanimous proposal at the next g8 meeting in saint petersburg
europe is providing our biggest ever aid to support the election process
it is very complex to maintain high rates of economic growth and low inflation
i believe that if the european political parties have one problem it is that in reality they are still federations associations of national political parties
mr president madam vice-president ladies and gentlemen i would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur on his report which i support fully and on all the work he has been doing in relation to the european political parties
we are finalizing a proposal for our assistance strategy for two thousand eighty nine onwards
this was confirmed by the heads of state at hampton court and this is a window of opportunity that we simply must seize and that is what the commission is doing
the lisbon strategy is in jeopardy through such lax behavior by member states
migrations are well and truly a phenomenon of the contemporary world
they are all over the place they try to hide tease them out keep the consumers happy

the president-in-office said in connection with turkey that it was a question of keeping the diplomatic channels open but in this case the diplomatic channels have already been blocked
i know it is of concern not only to danish members but to the house generally
we would also like to see harmonized procedures and specialized courts to implement the conventions of the hague and luxembourg
at the last plenary session it rejected an oral amendment by mr giansily and on monday evening in the committee on budgets it rejected my amendment again
first this supplementary and amending budget for nineteen ninety six will finally implement a new own-resource decision which goes back to the edinburgh european council in december nineteen ninety two
thank you mrs fouque
excuse me mr president but it is extremely difficult to speak when an argument is going on in the background
it rightly unleashed a wave of revulsion in the member states
this new start must not lead us into military blocs bristling with weapons but only to a new kind of common security system for europe
although the european union may be an economic giant it is regrettably a political dwarf on the world stage
if the commission refuses to move in this direction it must at least explain its reasons mr commissioner
does that inspire confidence
but i agree with all the others especially no 4 tabled by mr santini which is important if we are to get information across to the citizens
personally i have had occasion to get genuinely excited about some cases
and yet having said this i wonder how many citizens are aware of this wonderful opportunity
yesterday mr blak said that we should put an end to the circus
that was the aim of the commission 's policy or at least that is what it said at the time
the fact that the volume of production has been so successfully controlled does not mean that it can no longer run into problems and therefore be modified
these two types of produce may i remind you consume great quantities of cereals
in that way the present dual system in which expenditure is converted on the basis of one or other of the conversion rates will be abolished
so we now have an opportunity which must not be missed for an administrative simplification that business men are waiting for and which does not affect community interests
let them apply their legislation and seal any loopholes in it
portugal is very dependent on imported energy
both i and the committee think that the findings of the monitoring reports should be incorporated in the next annual report but in the form of findings with comments by the commission not of a 700-page document
it is always best to start at home
those improvements will be specifically along the lines recommended in your motion for a resolution
but it is only now that we are deciding at first reading on a not inconsiderable component of this driving licence namely harmonized codes
whilst we sympathize with the need to clarify the situation regarding drivers with diabetes we believe there are many other conditions that could also be cited
now we are dealing again with two very specific aims
the group of the european people 's party supports the commission 's proposal
on the one hand therefore loss of jobs loss of services to citizens loss of the european social model and on the other not even more work and probably not even enough replacement work
so we would like to know on what date that decision was taken
the eu member states must decide for themselves how regional policy efforts are to be deployed without having to go through brussels
amendment of rule 80 1
but this procedure can be confusing even for someone with a high iq and this was why our committee at your request mr president instructed me to present this report to you
in our view the problem is that the concept has actually been stretched to an extremely risky and dangerous extent
finally i should also like to say a word about the rights of the child
i should like to make a few brief comments about these
mrs plooij-van gorsel on behalf of the committee on research technological development and energy
equal treatment means equal rights and obligations for women men and pension funds
also to thank parliament for its generous response to what we have been seeking to do in so far as the final adoption of this proposal is concerned
although we shall see increased employment in the service and information sectors there will be a decrease in the production sector and further job losses in agriculture
similarly it is unrealistic to propose as of now a cut in working hours without loss of earnings thanks to automatic compensation by the state
that is why we need a clear set of rules
we cannot resolve the matter without you
legislation is of course powerless to prevent people from handling these foods carelessly in spite of all the instructions
clearly the whole procedure means that it will also be a question of reaching a political agreement among a majority of the member states and of course i cannot provide any kind of guarantee in that respect
from this viewpoint there is a need to develop greater flexibility in the labor market
countries like the united states and japan which have not reduced working hours but actually kept them longer than in europe have recorded job increases
the third question is that of funding
the debate is closed
there are distributional consequences no matter what way one looks at this problem
mr president to complete my picture of the main challenges which the union faces between now and the year two thousand ninety eight i must also mention the future financial perspectives and the enlargement of the union
in the light of these detailed exchanges of views with representatives of parliament and the commission the council established its draft budget for the financial year nineteen ninety seven
the president-in-office understood that was the basis of our willingness to work on reasonable margins in the various categories
this sort of neighborhood watch on internet does appear to result in efficient social control
there is a direct and proportional link between alcohol consumption in a country and the damage caused by alcohol
the commission 's sizzling attack on red tape which inhibits smes from penetrating the growing and powerful single european market is warmly welcomed
moreover in smes job growth is stronger than in large enterprises
if this is done in the right way it is questionable whether any general guidelines from the commission or an eu-level regulatory authority are needed
mr president i would like to compliment mr meier on his report on an important matter which is barely recognized as important by many
only yesterday in this house commissioner i asked you a question about safety standards on camp-sites in europe
sadly what we still find too often is a dissipation of powers which are still jealously guarded today
i should first like to congratulate mrs wemheuer on her excellent report
so i think it is a splendid thing that the danish prime minister has the courage to come out and say that he is ready to step up international cooperation within the eu on combating crime
i am sure that the national parliamentarians also went home a great deal the wiser and that this should produce results in their own parliaments
that ladies and gentlemen and madam president is all the information the commission can put before parliament at today 's sitting
these facts are important to an understanding of the recent development of our relations with turkey and the decisions taken a few months ago
but in this case it would be the armed forces
illegal immigrants ladies and gentlemen are a product of the law
we cannot withdraw our resolution because we are not confident that it would be realistic for a motion for a resolution demanding respect for human rights in colombia to be tabled next month
the demand for oil and coal and gas but mainly gas will increase and will only be met from external sources
the debate is closed
it is therefore obvious that i wish to defend my view that the report should be kept on the agenda
next concerning the issue of comitology
therefore i wish to assert that we are behind the rapporteur when he points out that the program needs a bigger financial contribution of at least 86 million ecus
mr president i should like to thank mrs fontaine for the sterling work she has done
thank you very much mrs gredler
for our part you may rest assured that our attitude will be the same as that displayed by parliament towards the commission
research education and youth environment internal market and the tens have all been included
i would therefore advise the house once again to remain consistent and to pursue a policy that is credible
the differences between its territories have become greater and inequalities have become more profound and these proposals for budgetary cuts inter alia to the structural funds do not exactly help to reduce those differences
seize that opportunity
yes it is true i have read the white paper
following that memorandum there is to be an announcement
how can one think that anything at all can be achieved through diplomacy with a military regime which allows diplomats to die in gaol and imprisons hundreds of politicians elected by the people
we have undertaken a number of actions to try to restore momentum to the peace process
regrettably however there is no evidence whatsoever from the dublin council or other council meetings that the same sense of urgency is shared by all member states
we will continue actively to use our influence with the regional parties with a view to promoting progress on the basis of the existing agreements
under commissioner flynn 's proposal council decisions would in future have to be taken by a qualified majority
assessing the results of this program is certainly very difficult
however it was only signed in june nineteen ninety six
the reduction of unemployment and the creation of new jobs is one of the most important tasks in the european union
there is no passport control between ireland and britain and there never has been since the foundation of the state
i repeat that as far as i am concerned we will not be a union until the day the passport goes
i had asked about the development of the single european market in which three of the four freedoms are a danger in my belief to children
it is interesting that the council representative has not denied the conclusions drawn by the swedish prime minister that emu could mean that the eu would develop into a state
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
the signal given by setting aside ecu 300 million for tens and research is not enough
we ourselves want to emerge from the yoke of maastricht europe which far from assuring peace and harmony among our peoples is consigning them to limitless immigration and unbridled competition
madam president ladies and gentlemen commissioner i think that what is now happening in afghanistan is not something that concerns only central asia which is to some extent generally affected by the rumblings of war
the supposed turkish cypriot state certainly does have that capacity
madam president parliament should know that the four murders in cyprus did not occur as the result of conspiracies by taliban-style fanatics or by hit men in the pay of drug traffickers
parliament approved the minutes
you had forgotten the alignment in the gatt negotiations on the blair house agreements
lastly we cannot agree to the commission 's proposal that this legislation should also be enforced against the american d 'amato act
there was even a scottish minister sitting there but no action was taken
finally the guarantee of comprehensive implementation of the provisions of the ' control regulation ' that is to say regulation eec no 2847 93 on satellite tracking and the recording of catches
the industry and different types of producer associations should normally be able to manage without subsidies
in addition however the proposal meets the requirement of allowing provision to be made for the possibility that the restoration of communal peace may be impeded or delayed because of the tenseness of the situation
i believe that sustainability must be a criterion for all development measures wherever we implement them whether in the health or education sectors or as in this case the environmental sector
there is a potential saving of 20 of energy demand largely through households and small firms
we view those two features of the save program as very important
and the commission will not be alone because the political leaders of the member states will themselves find it difficult to meet the commitments that they too have entered into
the directive that we are proposing to you specifically provides for measures designed to create that european audiovisual market so that the imaginations visions and personalities of our children and grandchildren are not left diminished
if this does occur we would only be benefiting the already all-powerful american audiovisual industry and it will be very difficult to develop a competitive and high quality european audiovisual industry
women in the eu are the most skeptical about cooperation
however a long transitional period has been provided for in finland to protect women 's previous rights
mr president first of all i wish to thank all of the commissioners who are competent for the different sectors which have been discussed in the committee on economic and monetary affairs for their attendance here
we want to see that that happens in the future
this ' economic policy council ' would be required to deliver an opinion on the guidelines presented by the commission after consultation of the european parliament
this is also possible - again it just requires the will
we must not forget that this proposal for a decision complements another one we examined recently on general health surveillance and this is how it should be seen
first you tell me that the primary mission of this observatory would be to ' know '
other amendments concerning the articles deal with additions which serve no real purpose either because they are superfluous from the legal point of view - nos 10 or 11 - or because they are implicit namely no 7
i believe therefore that we have enormous possibilities here
however the communication contains very little in the way of practical and functional information to remedy the problems considered as explained by the rapporteur mrs jensen
the upshot was that we arrived here from brussels on this special train very much delayed thirsty and far too late
of course an ecolabel only achieves anything if it is regarded as a reward a prize for top-quality ecological products and is independently supervised
obviously nothing is going to be said about pakistan or india about the economic exploitation of children and nothing is going to be said about exchange rate fluctuations
the promotion of this sector calls however for a very firm attitude on the part of those leading us
the meeting agreed to send immediately a special mission of the development ministers from ireland the netherlands and italy to make an assessment of the humanitarian situation and to identify ways and means to speed up humanitarian assistance
i know how delicate it is but how else are we to stop the killing in future
i do not believe this is the way to achieve great unity
in particular
has any discussion been held about breaking the tacis co-operation
could you be more specific as to whether this relates to the treaty
i think there is unity in diversity and i would like to say that i feel myself very much a soulmate of the honorable member in raising this question
the committee proceedings have resulted in a favourable view of the commission 's action plan for which particular thanks are due to the commissioner mrs bonino as the diligent and active sponsor of the plan
studies showing that glysophate produces substances similar to estrogen were disregarded as was the allergy risk
in addition to potential risks the immense repercussions on the environment are also referred to
i am very pleased about that
we have given far too little attention to the transport sector and to the potential of cogeneration
i believe it is essential for the european union to promote various community programs for those mediterranean countries which have a serious problem of water shortage
it is urgently necessary for the commission to change its course here
among the many imprisoned members of the opposition physical and mental torture death threats and undernourishment are the rule
many of the prisoners are suffering from tuberculosis and the death penalty exists and is often applied
i proposed a three-year derogation from the viewpoint of social impact to put the fleet in a position to comply with the regulations with a three-year period in which to do so
for instance it was parliament not the commission which insisted on the establishment of the fraud combat unit the uclaf
but this house will play its part in doing what is necessary to ensure that sound use of resource
she obtained a printed notice of her pension entitlement and learned that she could expect dm 1 130.00 per month
i return to where i began
a council working group has been examining the two proposals and on 11 november ecofin noted that substantial progress had been made particularly on the article 235 proposal
the worries that some people are expressing about the future of the european idea convince no one
would the president-in-office of the council confirm that monday 's ecofin will not take decisions as was reported to the british house of commons yesterday
thus monetarism celebrates its triumph in a situation which sees the disappearance not only of social considerations but even of relationships between currencies and growth or stagnation industrial development policies even economic trends
this affects regional traffic
the action of the commission in issuing this communication on structural assistance and employment is therefore highly commendable
let us ensure that it is expanded and made more accessible
the other thing that should be done mr president is to eliminate the paradox of a society full of unsatisfied social needs and growing unemployment
we accept it in the awareness of the need to put our finances our economies in order so as to provide the basis for sustainable development
that attack left four people dead a french citizen a canadian citizen and two moroccan students
the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 5 december nineteen ninety six pursuant to rule 95 of the rules of procedure has been distributed
the nineteen seventy eight labeling directive simply required the information on the label to be given in a language which the consumer understood
it is clear that in some of our areas and weak regions where structural funds come into play they are at risk of being canceled out for example by cap where it acts as a regressive factor
i am seeking to combat fiscal dumping and social dumping simultaneously
it is a budget for discipline and rigor and i believe it will be poorly received in our regions
behind the cutback i see a wish to provide ideological backing for national cutbacks in social and welfare policies adopted in the interests of maastricht
i think that a great deal of internal debate is required if we are to avoid a repetition in nineteen ninety seven and nineteen ninety eight of what has happened here in nineteen ninety six
the debate is closed
one does not need to be clairvoyant to predict that in the medium term this trend will lead to economic stagnation and produce adverse consequences for accession because the gap is still widening
a high degree of sincerity is required in the conduct of this debate
mr president enlargement gives us a unique opportunity to unite europe
welcome but once again premature is - in my view - the reference to codecision on agricultural issues which has to be decided and discussed in a more appropriate forum
i should like to ask you how things stand with regard to the process of ratifying europol and what the timetable is for finally bringing europol into operation
it is one of the technical difficulties but we are aware of them and we will have to take them into account in the final agreement that we reach with south africa
i think it is very important insofar as the integration of europe is concerned for the social dimension to be understood
all those living in the coal-mining areas are losing out
the commission and the advisory committee must carefully monitor and report on developments to the national regulatory bodies and to the players in the market
i shall explain why in a moment but let me first say something about the amendments we are accepting
if it has taken seven years for it to formulate some proposals the commission ought to wait the time it takes for council and parliament to legislate on such a sensitive and complex question
what does parliament really want
it would be good for all of us and also benefit the producers
nevertheless there are a number of elements which have been developed and it is these which we will be looking at during the european council
by the same logic why deprive ourselves any longer of all the advantages in terms of dynamism and job creation offered by an internal market genuinely functioning as an integrated internal market
the success of the next european council will in large measure be attributable to the quality of the irish presidency
in that respect the letter from chancellor kohl and president chirac is most encouraging
i would like to place on record the appreciation of the eplp for the excellent work of the irish presidency
may i finish with a call to the vigilance of french public opinion
herman recommendation
it needs to specify the guarantees controls and sanctions including - when necessary - the use of military force
he is exactly as old as i am and our age is revealed in the vademecum
if we succeed in establishing this principle we shall have taken a notable step forward
in any case there is no practical problem because the very sharp fall in the birth rate in europe means that there are on average ten applications for adoption for every abandoned child
but other issues are also addressed which are not within the competence of the union issues which are the concern of the member states not parliament
both reports refer to it with good reason
subject local and regional territorial pacts for employment
as it happens i am the minister responsible for local development in ireland
my question then is this is it the intention to put forward a proposal which means that information on refugees will be removed once the refugee has received a residence permit
however the sting in the tail was when he said that there are issues which should not be made public
what right have you to hold back certain issues when they concern the life of europe 's citizens
i will certainly take into account the concerns raised by members when we are trying further to advance the whole cause of transparency in the legislative process
what measures is the council taking to ensure that directive 92 57 eec and other health and safety legislation concerning construction sites are adhered to within the european union
as a result the infrastructure has seriously decayed
if i have achieved a middle way between fanatics of opposing views then i have acted in the true spirit of european consensus and therefore i have no hesitation in commending the report
there is also a serious legal problem that has not yet been clarified
can the commissioner also tell us when she will be able to tell us how she intends to introduce rules for other water sports surfers and the like
enlargement must not be conceived merely in terms of enabling candidate countries to make the transition to a market economy
mr president four weeks ago we heard the news that the european court of justice had said in answer to a british government case that sunday was not to be a special day for health and safety reasons
it was a unilateral form of electoral propaganda based on heavy manipulation of the press
i must point out to honorable members that they did decide to include the subject and as you know the rules do include an objection procedure if it is felt to be necessary
people with mental health problems are the one group of disabled people who can be deprived of their liberty i.e.hospitalized against their will or administered ect therapy without the involvement of the courts
votes
this restructuring plan must take account of specific national and regional features such as the wide diversity of fishing activities in my own country
but it defies belief that the commissioner is currently not prepared in evaluating the third magp to acknowledge the successes which the netherlands has recorded using its own system of management
so no budgetary argument can be advanced against it
these sort of actions have to be financed out of the eu budget which will then give the european parliament its proper role as the authority of accountability
i felt for reasons which may well be open to question that no purpose would be served by excluding the member concerned immediately
if the fight against drugs is a public priority it was an irish priority too and dublin has shown that it was a european priority
with the single currency europe will be able to limit very substantially the monetary upheavals which are disrupting whole sectors of our economies
you said that the commission is to be made responsible for coming up with a fraud-proof passport
unfortunately the compromise which has been reached is in danger of being stillborn since cold calling is dealt with in a different and less pragmatic way in the isdn directive
lastly there is the question of labeling on which - interestingly - almost everything hinges
it would have been monstrous to have done what the commission and council were close to doing - simply depriving consumers of choice
and should we not go for a eurocontrol convention which can be modified faster to take account of technological political or economic changes
mr president i think that mr castricum 's report makes a useful contribution to the debate on public transport
on the question of salmon the united kingdom - backed by ireland and finland - asked for a minimum import price
so even if the council was able in its wisdom to accept a program to limit fishing effort that would not end the story for there would be ever-increasing demands from the industry to allow more fishing
this can all be summarized in a few very simple words
i am proud to be associated with this step and i shall be very interested to hear from the commissioner who is here today whether the commission intends to respond positively to this request by parliament
i think that this is expressed in the unanimous decision in the committee on agriculture
the wto conference in singapore was not a ' complete success ' as the commission continually claims in its official reports
only where the food contains a living genetically modified organism will the regulation apply in full
in fact half of swedish net exports are products from the forestry industry
during the preparation of this report we were very concerned that it would advocate a joint forestry policy with tight control from above
the forests of europe also have an important role to play in terms of the greenhouse effect
as long as there is less felling than growth coal is stored in our forests and can therefore contribute to a reduction in excess carbon dioxide obtained through the burning of fossil fuels
a few more comments on procedural matters
why i would like to know did neither commission nor council think of separating the cis from the rest of the proposal in order to deal with it directly under article 235
we would all have liked to have been there and as president of the friends of music in parliament i would like to have had earlier notice
and we think no 12 would not be useful because it is more restrictive than the commission 's proposal
in our opinion flexibility is not and should not be the crucial issue at the igc
these are the three options we are examining at the moment
all too often we have preaching but no concrete action no practice
i believe that such attitudes apart from their folklore elements are deserving of censure
what is true for crime in general is all the more true for the extreme and specific type which is terrorism
what use is state sovereignty
improvements were made in aircraft safety
most important of all was the intensive international anti-terrorist cooperation which was quickly established
my first question to the commissioner this evening is how do we establish what these costs are
something else has become very clear which is that we still have here an unresolved conflict between parliament the council and the commission
i think we can agree with the conclusion that the third pillar is moribund
i have just been informed that in the original text mr gallagher 's name was mentioned
but there is a principle in law that every defendant is entitled to the protection of the law until proved guilty
resumption of the session
the reactors in service include some that western experts consider to be intrinsically unsafe and others that require technological improvements if they are to meet adequate safety standards
the treaty and the protocol also contain general statements about environmental aspects and improving energy efficiency
the social democrats in this house support the report and congratulate the rapporteur again on his detailed and good work
when we talk about the structural funds and employment we must recognize that the structural funds are not designed to generate immediate jobs and we need to concentrate on what we should expect of the structural funds
at the same time we all realize that the process of actually putting these key objectives into practice is still in its infancy
however the issue is not an easy one to us in the nordic countries for reasons to which mr hatzidakis among others has referred here
i say where relevant because exceptions are made to this requirement where the nature or purpose of the product makes the unit price meaningless or where indicating it does not provide any clear information for the consumer
i think we can say that no national committee of inquiry could have achieved what this one has and i think it has clearly extended the vital powers which this house enjoys
we do eat meat
tabling reforms at the intergovernmental conference along the lines of what i proposed three weeks ago excellent
firstly mr santer - and i very much welcome the fact - you have already adopted a number of absolutely essential reforms and secondly you have made some important announcements
it is also a question of farmers embracing the principle of sustainability which includes animal protection and keeping livestock in an appropriate way
through her help and the help of her colleagues we are finding out whether any further legislative action may be required in this field
we must not thoughtlessly jeopardize the measures taken in the three areas
the proposal that we create a ' buffer year ' after the 31 december nineteen ninety seven deadline seems to me to be reasonable
farmers have lost control of their industry
for example the cattle marking system amounts to an enormous population book-keeping exercise it relates to millions of individuals which moreover are replaced rapidly
only a while ago portuguese veterinary surgeons were protesting against the lack of controls on meat entering the country
the environment committee and the rapporteur myself insist that labeling should be applicable to beef-based products and processed products - i.e.by-products
the commission has obviously striven to protect the interests of the market and its relations with the british government before looking to the health of consumers
its powers should therefore be extended as far as joint decision in the agricultural field which risks ruining the very architecture of the common agricultural policy
many of us are convinced that our societies do not suffer from too much solidarity quite the opposite
for the rest you do not know what to do and moreover you cannot do anything
i hope that when the igc concludes - and the dutch presidency will play a big part in this - there will be an anti-discrimination clause that makes this impossible in the future
currently it is quite apparent that citizens who enter into contact with the banks and financial institutions have difficulty in evaluating the various services on offer
while i say that the commission is happy to accept all of the amendments i have to say categorically that i reject one thing mrs gebhardt said when she used the expression ' without enthusiasm '
i constantly had to prod the then commission to dig this dossier out and dust it off
i am a little concerned that both the report and the commission 's proposal suggest that we should
before the final vote on the report
infected with gold fever people were incapable of attaching any credence to timely warnings - the supposed prospect of fabulous wealth simply befuddled their senses
secondly i would call attention to the fact that sarajevo is becoming more and more of a muslim city making it difficult for non-muslims to enjoy equal rights there
to combat the advance of these ideas some have seen fit to occupy the same ground - other honorable members have referred to this
for this reason i also agree with and emphasize the references made to the budget in mrs baldi 's report
we see this through the absurd comitology committees which operate in brussels
accordingly it then rejects part of the expenditure a part which is in proportion to the risk involved
i also support the rapporteur 's proposals for greater awareness and encouraging those concerned to register their spouses in a tax incentive scheme
i regret to have to say that the belgian government is barking up the wrong tree on this point and is turning the clock back
the commission has undertaken to carry out a careful assessment of the situation to include broad consultations with all interested parties
thank you very much mr kellett-bowman
however we do not need to wait for the results of the intergovernmental conference to continue with the building of a legal framework which is better tailored to promoting equality of opportunity
the order of business was adopted
mr president if education is society 's main way to develop the individual 's physical intellectual and moral potentials training is the organization provision and acquisition of the necessary qualifications mainly for professional life
they tell me that a great many more chapter 2 aeroplanes are flying into ostend from developing countries than the respective annexes allow
we would call on renault to follow this example and to reverse its decision
but i do not agree with those who are taking advantage of the situation to launch an attack on europe or to target the free market economy
my group on the contrary would like to see them tightened
everything we are proposing today in the three reports goes in the right direction as i said
in almost all the eu member states the economy is being thrust into the straitjacket of the emu cohesion criteria
and the commission could enter the vast heritage of our museums art galleries and theaters into the network of available information
for instance if there is a problem we should not have to rely only on the book as the traditional means of gaining access to information but also have other smarter processing tools for looking at problems
the proposal also abolishes the distinction between research and trade which was not very useful in practice
the second amendment is based on our recent experience with the commission i am thinking for instance of the authorization of genetically modified maize
i am sorry if i spoke too quickly i was anxious not to take up too much time
the commission looks favourably on all measures which promote the integration of disabled people into the commission 's working environment
to mr bertens ' last question i would reply that the presidency assumes that all 15 member states will make a constructive contribution in brussels
that is what the whole discussion centred on when this measure was being prepared away back in the eighties so there is no question of any surprise element here
it is important in the light of sweden 's long experience 180-200 years of being a country free of military alliances
subject deadlines in areas which are part of the third pillar
in the council 's view how will the introduction of such deadlines affect enlargement of the union
despite efforts to prevent sudden infant death syndrome the number of deaths rose in ireland in nineteen ninety six following a steady decrease during the previous five-year period
that is hardly surprising in view of the fact that it was created in the late sixties when the community was smaller and the volume of trade was lower
i just wanted to say that the way you have conducted the business today has been to your credit
the white paper on education and training has been generally welcomed and has attracted largely favourable comments
the electoral process must establish a new president and a new parliament
for that reason we greens endorse the report by mr sakellariou and congratulate him on his excellent work
i want to comment on mr anastassopoulos ' remark about first and second class commissioners in the commission
for the first time we have proposals prompted by the agriculture budget to change the income supplements in order to meet the spending criteria

what we are now witnessing in albania and elsewhere is the result of economic failure
mr president ladies and gentlemen the barcelona conference of november nineteen ninety five aroused enormous hopes in all who dream of a genuine euro-mediterranean partnership
lastly a real solution must be found to the problem in kosovo
this was a crime either of omission or more likely of commission when their boat was deliberately rammed and sunk
the democracy movement is subject to repression and for years now mrs aung san suu kyi president of the national league for democracy has been under house arrest
this decision may be made subject to conditions designed to guarantee a minimum level of production in the areas in question and respect for the ecological balance
political risks are regarded as arising from the banning of foreign currency transfers compulsory payments wars and internal unrest
we have to be more prudent with our responsibilities for the community budget
given the increasing individualization and flexibility on the labor market the time seems ripe for a complete overhaul of the social security systems in the member states
mr president you and i have many happy encounters here on the floor
i heard this morning in my country 's media that the trade unions have accepted the principle of resuming work because the closure of the plant is now unlawful and an entirely new procedure is beginning
once again the lobby has been more effective than anyone else
this is somewhat frustrating since it is an important debate and there are many issues which deserve to be commented on
this is what we have attempted to do both in connection with the maize and in connection with labeling
the debate is closed
this evolutive approach is also justified by the fact that the classic declarations and texts are also the result of an evolution which took place over several centuries before arriving at a legally binding codification
some people are allowed to be here because of their nationality and others whom we call foreigners are allowed to stay because they have lived here for a long time
it is high time for this to happen
so if we want to have a discussion about how we conduct a balanced economic program to cover various exigencies as they arise let us have it up front and openly
if you or i or we together throw our money down the drain it cannot be used for sensible purposes
question no 30 by konstantinos hatzidakis h-0225 97
on 24 march the council took a formal decision for the ec to conclude the ita
since no request for safeguard measures has been received by the commission from a member state a quantitative measure cannot at present be envisaged
as regards objective ii i would ask you to appreciate that at this stage i cannot give what amounts to a guarantee that specific aims will continue to receive support
today mr president i want to stress the need for this directive but above all the importance of the modifications expertly piloted through by the rapporteur which parliament will no doubt approve tomorrow
we now have an opportunity to show that we intend to do something
in presenting this report i would first like to mention the criticisms which can be made of the studies the commission has presented on the auto oil directive

mr president i am speaking on behalf of the rapporteur mr franco malerba
right from the start she was hand in glove with the council and the commission fought more against parliament than with it for more money for research

if we are talking about a release of funds by the eib incredible though that may be then a closer inspection proves to be somewhat sobering
in this debate our actions cannot be preventative or defensive in nature nor be based on formulae which may have been valid in the past but are not so valid today

instead we should invest in training research and quality if europe is to revive employment
i am sure the intention of parliament is to apply high valuation standards to all initiatives for budgetary spending regardless of their source

thirdly i would like to thank my colleague mr deprez whose cooperation over many months has been superb

the proposal for the committee to coordinate bilateral and community cooperation is too ambitious and exceeds the competence of the committee

the fact that president eyadema has been in power for thirty years now and seems intent on not calling his own role into discussion is clearly an obstacle to the full implementation of real democracy in the country

parliament has noted once again that the untied states and other countries with a high naval construction capacity at world level are continuing their repeated refusal to ratify the nineteen ninety four

we believe that the overall process has been acceptable although it is true that - as you could see - certain problems relating to both the voting and the counting were identified during the electoral campaign
the monetary policy of the countries signing up to emu is the preserve of the european central bank ecb which is subject to no political supervision and has no political responsibility
a good many jokes have been made about the word comitology but we should not forget that we are talking about the role of the institutions and the opening up of the legislative process to the citizens
this was not the case and the treaty entrusted the commission with the responsibility of presenting proposals on comitology
we now come to the amendments
lectures highlighting the parallels between european and arab theology and thought
on the occasion of the stockholm conference held last april a debate on culture and civilisation was held as part of the follow-up to the barcelona declaration
europe has specific interests
when we know what the russians want we can act at their side
for precisely that reason it would be entirely inappropriate to talk the world into even more crises and disasters
the answer will naturally have a decisive influence on the vote
the turkish government 's refusal to take part in the european conference and turkey 's action in breaking off the political dialogue with the union are bad and regrettable developments
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen today we are examining the success or failure of the customs union with turkey
in this context the austrian presidency is seeking a dialogue with all the conflicting parties
firstly according to its members any long-term solution to the east timor issue must respect the wishes of the east timorese people
the commission acknowledges parliament 's desire to be informed about the work of the committees assisting it this aspect however is dealt with in a commission proposal relating to a new decision of the committee
it is in fact not one system but 15 variations on a system which makes it extremely complicated
i should like to highlight one point in particular women must be allowed and entitled to choose part-time work so as to be able to reconcile working life with their domestic and family responsibilities
mr president during the economic crisis in the 1930s certain countries including mine passed legislation or regulations forbidding access by women to the civil service for example
mr president i should like first of all to compliment the rapporteur mrs colombo svevo on her comprehensive report to which there is really nothing to add
since you are amending an oral amendment i fear there may be some confusion
i agree with most of what the report says but i voted against it because of its suggestion that if turkey meets certain criteria it can ' automatically ' join the eu
the fight against terrorism which must be unrelenting can only be strengthened if there are clear laws and penalties
rivalries that could have been settled by discussion not only still persist but have degenerated into serious strife sparked by ethnic or religious claims
we have held many debates and the commission and the council have always had our full support
we agree with these points not least because the rates of vat on food for example impose the same burden on high and low income groups and thus have an unequal financial impact on different groups in society
strengthening the equal opportunities policy is a full but completely new component of policy aiming at creating employment and fighting unemployment
however this discussion has tended to focus too much on control in eu waters with insufficient attention paid to control of eu activities in international waters and in the waters of third countries
from the development point of view we are seeking to help countries in thethird world
however the results of the votes are usually shown so quickly that there is no time to write them down
these events are details of world war two
the union 's common rules on money laundering and chemical precursors have also had an important part to play but we cannot afford to close our eyes to the major discrepancies still in existence as regards narcotics
the right monetary policy instruments must be deployed if the european central bank is to enjoy credibility
the ppe group has no doubts as to the ability of the central bank 's management to make the right judgements and decisions
votes
this quite farcical situation at least has the merit of showing that the ecb is primarily concerned with the repressive side of its action
meanwhile we consider that the court of auditors should also verify that the measures taken are appropriate
mr president i would firstly like to add my congratulations to those for the rapporteur mr tappin as he has drawn up an excellent report
it has also been suggested that serious economic problems as well as unpaid wages and the possible neglect of maintenance operations may adversely affect the country 's capacity to produce nuclear energy safely
in order to make this easier some member states allow citizens of other countries to declare their arrival through forms completed in hotels campsites or guest houses and a copy of this is sent to the local authorities
the community 's obvious concern over the problem of private funding for transport infrastructures has led the commission to present a communication on public-private partnerships in the trans-european transport network projects
my colleague mrs malone in particular will be commenting on malta i do not therefore wish to go into detail on that now
as chairman of the delegation to the eu-malta joint parliamentary committee i have been a privileged and attentive observer of maltese political life for two years
unfortunately perhaps because it had not been prepared in sufficient detail many countries provisionally rejected this idea in salzburg saying that it was premature
yesterday evening i was in contact with the opposition in belgrade
mr president in the middle ages monks used to call meat fish and were therefore easy in their consciences when they ate it
it is just not acceptable that having appointed a special envoy he should be vetoed by mr milosevic for three years and that during that time a whole series of community political representatives should troop off to belgrade
by way of an example i recall what we saw in russia during the war in chechnya that was a very similar situation
among the large number of commission initiatives on common rules within the eu for safety at sea this proposed directive is both necessary and particularly relevant
there is thus no need for a directorate for tourism in the commission and there is also no need to appropriate more funds for this sector
it is presented in two parts
contributions have become fairer as they are now a more accurate reflection of member states ' ability to pay as expressed by their gross national product
but it is too early to say with any certainty what will happen on this front since so much depends on the final agreement on the reforms of the common agricultural policy and the structural funds
that is what we should be discussing
the actual declarations of intent were also hardly implemented
these diseases and their links with the modern chemical world are an uncharted problem area
the phenomenon must therefore be investigated for pathogenic interactions between two or more environmental pollutants as mentioned in amendments nos 12 and 13
we prefer an advisory committee rather than a mixed advisory management committee which would ultimately restrict the commission 's activities
i think that parliament will be able to approve the text tomorrow with the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and a step forward will therefore be taken
the only outstanding point at issue between parliament and the council of ministers concerns the responsibility for choosing between a course and an aptitude test
the second point is the following
in this way we could also help improve transparency of cost in the internal market in electricity
i would first like to congratulate our rapporteur
they are mr tobback 's words
i would end with this question are there perhaps first class victims and second class victims of a defective policy
madam president although this has already been said there is reason to note that the slovak people have realized that in a democracy it is possible to change the future of one 's country
i hope on behalf of the group of the european people 's party that the sakharov prize has the necessary international standing to finally help to free this brave fighter from danger
however the commission is deeply concerned by the current restrictions applied by the malaysian authorities to the rights of assembly free speech and communication
in all events even if these measures were carried out only 57 of the united states ' arrears to the united nations would be covered
apart from the amendments adopted unanimously in committee we have only one additional amendment from mr blokland
it is very questionable whether the eu should devote large amounts of funding to the fusion research establishment jet
firstly we want to make the existing regulations much simpler
we shall now proceed to the vote
but that is another story
this is precisely the point that we must discuss
in any event i regard the commission 's communication on biodiversity as enormously important because it touches the essence of europe 's policy on nature and nature conservation
madam president this proposal for a directive relates to austria and germany 's derogation from the duty-free arrangements
the nineteen ninety nine budget is the last under the current financial perspective and will therefore mark the end of an era
in real terms this expenditure is actually lower than nineteen ninety eight and will this year represent no more than 42.2 of the total commitments
i know my party leader and i know john and i know that my party leader and seamus mallon will be in brussels at the part-session at the beginning of november
the problem is that a great deal of eu spending does not prevent but causes damage
mr president nobody is more convinced than i am of the general usefulness of a budgetary interinstitutional agreement and some medium-term prospects
last year we expressly asked the commission to clarify an important budget line namely accompanying measures
mr president i certainly would like to make a small contribution to this debate
if the lawyers get to look at it the system is doomed from the start
it is a joint effort that is giving rise to a real convergence in terms of the community income
my question for mr liikanen is this what does the commission think about changing the title of a budget line when we actually have a legal base
we also wanted to prevent public funds from being used for the electoral campaigns of certain candidates or certain parties
mr president i think that the majority of us support the report under consideration here
self-evidently that is nonsensical
moreover their coverage is far from complete
in particular the uruguay round agreement on trade-related investment measures which impinge on investment
i would like to draw your attention to the fact that the french government is not alone
that does not mean that there should be any agreement
the agreement will be amended and further negotiations will take place
surely we cannot say that we are adopting something that has been the state-of-the-art for two years already
on the one hand they are carcinogenic and cause brain damage and many other forms of damage by their direct effects i.e.on people who work with the substances
the reason why europe is a haven of stability at the moment is that monitoring mechanisms and better practices have produced results
madam president mr president of the commission from one year to the next the report on the state of the union sends out the same message of self-satisfaction
the initiative still to be discussed this year on the eu 's northern dimension will create much-needed sustained and systematic cooperation between russia and the eu
in fact german-speaking journalists have already protested about this in the house
the presidency has set up working parties in belgrade and geneva to coordinate the international activities
in any event it is a solution
it was like spain in nineteen thirty six where the right-wing majority gil robles ' ceda had its activities curbed and its leaders and militants assassinated not to speak of the anti-catholic atrocities
mr bangemann i would like the white paper to be a little more equal to the task and to set out the huge challenge that we are facing
here the situation is markedly better in the united states and japan
first of all we wish to extend the scope of the directive so as to include dust from certain types of wood and category 1 and 2 mutagens
this split vote was requested at the appropriate time by the groups and will take place
we hear talk of the problem of the statute for members and of inequality but the member states are responsible for the situation of their members
the europe of citizens only has meaning if it refers to a project that allows europe to respond to the everyday concerns of its citizens
human rights are not left-wing or right-wing issues they are universal and they need our constant support wherever they are violated
we must not therefore make the mistake of examining the needs and wishes of farmers in mountain areas in isolation without reference to all the other less-favoured areas
i also agree with the breakdown of spending by economic characteristics restitutions intervention etcetera together with the review of control systems in some sectors
this is equivalent to the community 's financial obligations in the agricultural sector for about two days in the year
to conclude mr president our group would like to point out that community policy both on an external and agricultural level is in conflict with european policies on the environment and animal welfare
i agree that libraries need to work with each other at european level and for me the main question here is which institution should deal with this
as the rapporteur 's analysis shows libraries are confronted with a very wide range of problems
mr president ladies and gentlemen as a representative of agriculture let me point out how important it is to have sensible rules for farmers on defective products
mr president ladies and gentlemen in the past the european parliament has often expressed the importance it attaches to culture and to europe 's cultural future
when is the commission finally going to do something to get rid of this flagrant example of a democratic deficit
small and medium-sized firms must be more involved in the community programs and i would mention here the third multiannual program which will next year be open to some of the applicant countries
there are one or two points where i would have wished things to be different
we have also emphasised the importance of new technology
with all due respect to mrs roth-behrendt it is not a matter of good consumers who are the injured parties on the one hand and bad farmers who are thus the guilty parties on the other
it represents a significant step forward for consumer protection
a letter signed by the secretary-general on behalf of the commission was sent to the officials concerned expressing the dissatisfaction of the institution with their management performance
there were 30 points in the original text and barely half have been implemented
mr president the characteristics we demand from pharmaceutical products are quality safety and efficacy
he stated just now that 40 years on the community member states ' customs authorities still do not cooperate
secondly when systems are simpler decentralisation to delegations comes as a logical consequence
the next item is the report a4-0381 98 by mr hughes on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs on the communication from the commission social action program 1998-2000 com 98 0259 - c4-0343 9
i would therefore urge people to take heed of paragraph 13 in mr peter 's report
that is quite understandable because independence does not necessarily mean isolation
so we need to consider what would be the best way forward now in order to deal with the situation and get negotiations going in the wto in any event
i went with a group of other members of this house from different countries and different political groups to taiwan last week at the invitation of their ministry of foreign affairs to observe their election campaign
we are talking about democracy projects the fostering of democratic development in eastern europe including the new independent states of the former soviet union
all too often we forget that the directives which we adopt will in many instances apply in norway and iceland too
this really is good news given the particular difficulties involved in these negotiations
we are not aiming to demolish anything in the member states and we are not aiming to demolish the eu 's policies
there appears to be a climate emerging in which instead of the old iron curtain we now have a smokescreen of fine words concealing the council 's true intentions which are to postpone the accession of new members
i would cordially ask you to invite your foreign minister and your chancellor to take your words to heart so that we can achieve a better policy here
heckling and applause we have adapted everything
there is nothing to stop a company appealing for greater flexibility in working time whenever the opportunity presents itself
mr president the amendments tabled by our group reflect this aim
this means there can be a response to problems which go well beyond the work dimension and instead involve the whole person which is something worth highlighting
the purpose of the mission was to seek means of actively involving the european union in the implementation of the wye plantation agreement
at the same time the adoption of co-funding will have an adverse effect on the flow of funding from the structural funds to the union 's poorer countries so increasing the inequalities that exist already
madam president mr president-in-office of the council commissioner nobody doubts that a reform is necessary and nobody doubts that the common agricultural policy is not entirely fulfilling the role assigned to it in the treaty
the problem is that the commission is leaving these issues to be decided at national level
ladies and gentlemen i hope you are in good form because there are 760 amendments and mr cot and i will try to ensure that the morning passes as smoothly as possible
mr president i did say at the beginning that i would take the four minutes allocated to mr schulz and i therefore spoke both for the committee on legal affairs and for my group
i know i am pleased to say that the european commission is pursuing an active policy to promote the freedom of the press in the former yugoslavia
mr president on behalf of the commission allow me to firstly thank mr pirker very sincerely for his excellent report and for what seems to me to be his very convincing support for our proposal for a directive
i consider it to be particularly important that parliament is successfully tackling this today so that we simply keep to our timetable
mr president i think that today we have seen how without the eu we should have not reached this binding agreement
there are some interinstitutional rules which must be respected
i have only three remarks to make on the subject
consequently the question we are asking ourselves here in the european parliament in the council and in the commission is whether it would not be appropriate to take steps to encourage investment
prior to a european council meeting all we can do is to formulate wishes
we do not need to do that in the european union but what we do desperately need is an arrangement so that everyone can have a piece of the employment cake
we do not accept religious or cultural reasons as an obstacle to turkey 's accession to the european union
many thought this could not be done and certainly could not be done in the timescale
no malicious attack by the media which some people are trying to orchestrate must divert us from that principle
so i think it would be a good thing for me to read out the dutch text as i intend it and then the translation in english
according to the rapporteur bulgaria has made substantial efforts to ' speed up the privatisation process and to further develop the conditions for a functioning market economy '
the global community has to put pressure on the turkish government to persuade turkey to sit down at the negotiating table
i have to say that it still has some way to go but there are sufficient grounds for progress in the view of the majority of the committee for us still to go ahead and grant discharge
but that is not by any means my problem at the moment because we will certainly know one way or the other on thursday
we have succeeded in again making full codecision necessary for all future changes to the framework research program as stipulated in the treaties
i have to say that a conciliation is actually fought with very unequal weapons
central and eastern european countries will be part of the research program as well via the phare program and switzerland will join them in a few years once it has signed the agreement
now comes the real challenge
i believe these will be areas of nuclear fission research which will be well suited to this program
mr president i wish to focus on the section in the framework program covered by mr argyros which deals with competitive and sustainable growth
in essence not enough thought has been given since nineteen ninety five to how the commission should be run
i shall finish there mr president
therefore i would expect that the commission by one means or another to be able to transfer and agree to the topping-up appropriations which might be necessary as far as our external policy is concerned
we are astounded at the arrogance shown in this report and the contempt displayed for the democratic choices made in three of these countries
to put an end to this inflexibility we tabled the so-called strategic amendments
i believe that the assessment would have appeared more objective if you had mentioned parliament 's increasingly decisive legislative action particularly since the maastricht treaty
how many of them are taken on as officials under the simplified procedure
i give the floor to mrs gradin to answer mrs theorin 's question
as for the methods we must bear in mind that 25 of europeans - i repeat 25 - are a target population which cannot be reached at all by means of the methods used to date
a fairly long transitional period will enable people to pay with the old currency and the euro
the other important aspects are the treaty and article 103a of the treaty
instead the member states can try to improve their competitiveness by allowing the economic crisis to filter down through the pay structure with lower minimum wages and poorer working conditions as a result
this illustrates how great the challenge still is to us if we are to achieve basic human rights for the world 's poor and deprived
and to my knowledge systems of this kind although of course they must certainly not be underestimated have not led to any incidents hitherto
the council fully endorses the peace plan accepted by both parties and approved by the security council which involves the holding of a free just and impartial referendum on self-determination for the people of western sahara
mr president mr habsburg-lothringen in the past year bosnia-herzegovina has taken great strides forward
that is consistent with a position which we in the netherlands have long maintained a drugs user is primarily a patient and the dealer is a major criminal who must be severely punished
we therefore regret that there was not a majority for this at the time
the document presented by the commission states that at present co2 emissions are at a level of 170 g km while eurostat figures show a level of at least 186 g km
mixed reactions
all costs including those arising from enlargement are to be met from within this perimeter
we do not know if these deadlines will be respected
global inequality has increased dramatically during two centuries which have been dominated by neo-liberalism
i am therefore very curious to learn how the commissioner sees the practicalities of this arms embargo and control procedures
the commission and the council can help ensure that pakistan takes this call seriously
adoption of an additional protocol to the international convention on the rights of the child banning military recruitment of children under 18 would be one important stage
the commission 's powers in this area are as you know limited since this subject is normally dealt with at council level and by other institutions such as the council of europe and the united nations
the success of the rhine in this mode of transport was a recurring theme of the hearing in brussels
in those countries there is still broad scope for tempus the only instrument with the potential at present in those areas to support the university sector in adapting effectively to the new social and economic circumstances
on a point of order mr president
for me this is initially more a question of substance and aims than of reappraising legal bases
mr president mr president-in-office of the council let me turn first to our institution
there are thus two main aspects to this report form and substance
in the past therefore institutions have been able to treat the principle of confidentiality in a cavalier fashion and they continue to do so today
however we do not agree that all council meetings should be public
setting conditions that are too rigid is more likely to prove counter-productive
in order for latvia to be competitive its levels of pay have to remain low
estonia is indeed ahead of the other countries in some respects
mr president i too wish to stress that those four reports can have a positive effect
observance of social rights in international trade is a fundamental issue and one that has been under consideration for more than a century without any significant results
i can assure you that dutch tugs have penetrated the hamburg market and tugs from hamburg are achieving the breakthrough in antwerp
that is why we ask the commission to carry on working with the current legislation
such decisions must remain a matter for the member states
we do not feel that is satisfactory so we have retabled that
moreover before the final decision is adopted parliament should have the right to contribute for a limited period of time to the debate on the commission 's proposals on the implementing measures
if we do not then our competitors certainly will
what is more the effects of the crisis have not been sufficiently analyzed and in the agricultural guidelines the margin needed to finance rural development will undoubtedly be reduced
for some this will mean fertilisation using urban sludge with all the risks associated with it
commissioner in your position regarding the resolutions adopted by parliament you will need to remember this
as i pointed out mrs mann i accept amendment no 9 tabled by mr kittelmann as a replacement for paragraph 19 on the understanding that the rest of the resolution namely paragraphs 20 21 and 22 remains unchanged
however the political and economic pressures on these countries are enormous
this is because the public feels the impact of european policies on their daily lives but fails to see any evidence in europe of the democratic practices they are accustomed to in the different member states
we were happy with amendment no 4 however
maritime transport and therefore ports play a vital role in terms of both people and goods
in the context of the celebrated public-private sector cooperatives the commission is trying in this branch as well to hand over the prime profit-making activities to the shipowners
perhaps it is true that we spend a great deal of money but we do not spend it in such a way that it benefits the people working on the farms
but i do not know what he said on this issue so i cannot comment
mr funke has just given a very clear explanation of what is important in relation to the competitiveness of european agriculture
are we again to have all the different national quality marks and an additional quality mark that can be recognized eu-wide as mr mulder requested before in his report
and there are established rights
mr malerba and other members have participated in such events in the past and we very much hope that this practice will continue
we all share in that hope
thank you for your reply commissioner monti
the directive also called upon the commission to submit fresh proposals for further liberalisation by the end of nineteen ninety eight
it is also important to note that in connection with this convention the council adopted a legal instrument simultaneously signed by the member states concerning the interpretation of the convention by the european court of justice
we find that unacceptable
how sad that the socialist group has been playing political games with this only to get cold feet at the vital moment
the minimal progress we have made in this area compared with the headlong progress we have made in the financial economic and many other spheres of community activity is now causing serious problems
the commission believes that the european union will only be able to adopt further sanctions through a un security council resolution
it is primarily aimed at promoting the application of the convention on the rights of the child which was ratified by guatemala in nineteen eighty nine in the hope that the juvenile and adolescent code will be implemented
other examples can also be found where coordination in scandinavia is necessary
the committee feels that pursuing a family policy at european level is impossible and undesirable for the following reasons
firstly what would the developments now being proposed mean for small and medium-sized firms
this is why a european code of conduct is both useful and necessary and i support the idea
as is made clear in a report out of 17 potentially relevant eu support programs there is not a single one that aims specifically to provide export support for renewable energies
but what should replace them
even a moderate slowing down in growth can have very negative consequences if it occurs in a country that has no room for maneuver
the report argues in favor of tighter controls on third-country vessels and on the so-called flags of convenience as regards both access to resources and landing
as the members of the committee on fisheries are already aware the commission does not fully support the idea of a global ban on discards for a number of reasons
what does
the more environment-friendly our farming is the more jobs that will imply and not the reverse
that concludes this item
an estimated 300 rivers lakes and sources of groundwater are located in international border areas
only democracy could help china to rid itself of such contradictions once and for all
i feel it is now a far better balanced report
the political and economic reforms go together
mr president i agree with mr azzolini when he says that regions which are coming out of objective 1 must not be treated as strictly as the commission is proposing to do
while recognizing that it may be a diplomatic formality as we say in the resolution at the same time it is very effective and signals a change of opinion in the united states
secondly the people of europe have hitherto made little use of the single european job market
we therefore call on the commission to bring forward a proposal on this shortly
these poor hens usually die after a year they last no longer than that whereas a normal chicken usually lives for four to five years
lowering guaranteed prices to world market level is going too far in our view
in our view the intervention price for butter and skimmed milk powder should be reduced to the world market level meaning a cut of 30 instead of the proposed 15
however we are doubtful - or indeed critical - regarding some of the specific proposals for example the so-called horizontal measures and every possible outcome needs to be more carefully examined
i think it is our task to help bring agricultural production up to date and not cling to old production methods which do not take account of animal welfare
it is not happening fast enough in our opinion but it is a partial victory that the amendments seeking to abolish this method of production over the next ten years have been adopted
we really are talking about very long transition periods if we start to enact laws now that will not come into force until the year two thousand ninety six
some of the landfill sites that are being closed down pose major problems so it is essential that these sites also come under the directive
the first of these involves strengthening the internal market
just as with the initiative on the taxation of carbon dioxide emissions once again it is being claimed that the targets are fiscal neutrality and the replacement of taxes on labor thereby helping to create jobs
madam president we should certainly be moving towards fiscal harmonisation in the energy sector
we cannot manage such an instrument without dealing with immediate competitors and neighbors as there is a danger of weakening this important service sector in the european union
indeed arrangements of that nature already exist in 11 member states
confession as we say in english is good for the soul
at present for instance we are running 16 minutes over the finishing time for our services including the interpreters
i think you would need to be the invisible man or jump down from a satellite
of course when such solutions have not been forthcoming she has sought to point out discrepancies in a way that i consider to be very constructive
it so happens that this was the position we adopted in the council but it was unanimously voted down
these three issues must be resolved
but it is still the social democrats who believe they can protect us against the effects of the euro through new centralised control instruments
in essence the whole way the system operates is changing especially with the enlargement approaching and after the launch of the euro
it often happens that conflicts flare up again in the wake of a military peacekeeping mission because the causes of the violence have not been addressed
the stability pact and the desire for transparency currently prevalent in europe will in practice lead to fiscal convergence
the aim is to circumvent tax legislation for ' residents ' and to avoid paying tax
is it not time to face up to reality and accept that this reform as proposed will not work
there is clearly a certain ambiguity as regards the british french dutch and danish overseas countries and territories as some of these regions still seem to be evolving
for that reason on 17 december nineteen ninety eight the council adopted a comprehensive program to supply agricultural produce to russia
here cyprus can continue to count on the full support of the european union and of the entire international community
in fact it is precisely because of this lack of investment that some might say that there is an excess of water and thus justify transfers to other more developed areas
the same constructive involvement lay behind the recent informal talks between parliament the council and the commission and as mr eisma pointed out this was largely an innovation
mr president on the 12-year question the committee called for a 12-year time-limit where there are safety doubts
we have now tabled amendment no 77 which reverses the burden of proof by saying that the commission must provide proof to the contrary
that really will drive the small and medium-sized enterprises that we keep supporting and praising in our electioneering speeches out of the market
that would be like saying that a 20-year-old car had to meet the euro 4 standard for two thousand ninety one under the current legislation on exhaust gas
these elements are central to the commission 's proposal and we cannot accept any watering-down of them
i should like to make a few comments although i do not know if i shall receive any response to them
conversely however scientific cooperation can only flourish in the long term in a peaceful environment
we are therefore also against cooperation between the eu and israel in this field
they dealt with this issue in a very short space of time and almost unanimously support the conclusion of the scientific and technical cooperation agreement between the european community and the state of israel
this debate brings to light several fundamental points dealing with both the nature of the common agricultural policy and the actual running of the european institutions
in this way we can be justified in our desire to see the double majority adopted in the long term as this is a guideline that the vast majority of the house can ratify
to conclude i should like to highlight the quality and importance of the work carried out by the rapporteur in the hope of helping european institutions to cope with the challenges they have yet to meet and overcome
this is why it is important that european firms and research institutes should be able to operate in the same way as their partners in america and japan
madam president may i make an initial remark outside my allotted speaking time
it would be unfair to sanction the entire region
the economic and social conditions are such that in my view albania can rightly be described as a third world country on the union 's doorstep
our group supports them in their entirety
this is what albania needs in the long run
we cannot achieve complete control in these areas we can only do a little here to help the albanians to help themselves but we should do whatever we can
behind all the arguments about wines and spirits port and sherry lies raw agricultural protectionism
we have just been talking about turkey today but poland hungary the czech republic estonia latvia and slovakia also want to join
the situation at the time meant that the commission was unable to give the go-ahead
what we want to do is get the regions and the communities involved in the design of the policy and updating on a regular basis
this step is necessary if we are genuinely to involve fishermen in the decisions which affect them and offers the only clear and practical means of recognizing the unique variables that exist in the fisheries sector
mr whitehead i am a doctor
in the vote i would like to see the proposal to include beer extended to include cider also
if there is a feeling that article 43 should also be included because we are dealing with disparate products that can naturally be done too
i do not think the european union can remain passive on this question
of course we have to try to prevent possible disasters
when we refer to safety at work we automatically think of the structures already in place
fortunately parliament 's amendments to the commission text from first reading have to a large extent been taken up by the council
the commission can and should show the way by deciding on the objectives and accountability mechanisms cooperating with new policy players strengthening the methodological framework overhauling its own structures and introducing gender equality at the decision-making level
at the time the commission was waiting for the court of justice 's judgment and for the negotiations in the run-up to the amsterdam treaty
these amendments have a direct bearing on the new legislative powers
the europe of nations group has voted in favor of mr corrie 's report
on the basis of the above considerations we have decided not to vote against the report
we all know that the future of society depends on women and so everyone is in favor of equality parity and justice
high-voltage power lines gsm radio transmitters and many domestic appliances are disrupting the natural balance
this is a vital point in that resources are the overriding problem in our attempt to achieve common standards and respond to public health requirements
so what we want to achieve is the active involvement of the public and especially of those who are sick of the patients
our goal is to be in a position to present the new action plan by the end of the spring - in may
how much further do we want it to fall
immediately took rather longer than we would normally understand by the word
could the commissioner at least assure this house that he will take seriously inland waterway links with the important points that ports constitute for our trans-european networks
rail is in competition with road as mrs moreau says and the tragedy is that rail for the last three decades has become an increasingly poor second

our minister mr funke will also be taking part in separate discussions with parliament on agricultural policy shortly
measures have already been taken to assess the damage and the results were analyzed recently in brussels with the international donor community

we originally asked for the court of auditors to produce a report on this use of euratom funding but mrs aelvoet has tabled two amendments that go even further and we in our group intend to support her
if we want to be consistent these gains are necessary and they are possible as well
madam president the framework program now under discussion combines all the elements of the eu energy policy and will hopefully help to coordinate the eu 's work and make it more effective
madam president mr stockmann sounded rather resigned when he said that the issue of energy efficiency is not exactly centre-stage in political debate at present
this form of energy is experiencing tremendous growth in navarre for example a region that already meets 20 of its needs in this way
first of all the lack of concern shown by the european parliament in my view about fighting fraud in the tobacco sector
in this context may i also say that we can certainly take decisive action to curb currency speculation which is also a destabilising factor by showing some long-overdue willingness to introduce the tobin tax
nothing new there then
in my view if it represents two thirds of the total amount it is already huge
the main priority of these agreements is to support democracy and human rights in line with parliament 's wishes
the underlying cause of the unrest in the moluccas lies in the serious political and economic crisis that the country is going through

in may nineteen ninety eight the council said that there should be limits to the commercial risk borne by importers in the eu and it instructed the commission to do something about it
the present partnership will go much further
mixed reactions
mr president i am surprised and saddened at the petty political way in which some colleagues are seeking to profit from what is an extremely serious situation
from now on the european parliament must fulfil the expectations of the people of europe as regards the ways in which it should tackle these issues
nevertheless we are open to other reasonable solutions
mr president there are some perfectly legitimate aims in this report such as the simplification of the vat system which is designed to prevent fiscal distortion between member states and to simplify procedures by adopting the country-of-origin principle
in fact i tabled an amendment on the subject at first reading which was accepted
before an agreement such as the mai comes into existence it should be compared with the evaluations which have been made and the decisions which have been taken as set out at the major un conferences
it has attracted attention not because of its aims and purpose to be the flagship for the european union 's vocational training policy but because it has become associated with mismanagement fraud secrecy and nepotism
the tender procedures were not evaluated on a neutral basis
i would prefer to focus on the importance of the leonardo program since it is linked to the socrates and youth programs
we should be prepared to help a little and see if we can alleviate even to some small extent the dreadful misery of what are in other respects really very decent people
the report specifically reflects the idea that it really is a battle against drugs - and that means all drugs

the present climate should be highly conducive to moving the boundaries here
a repressive approach should always be accompanied by a strong social commitment
first of all what kind of information do we hope to gather and how do we hope to gather it
mr president my attendance is not recorded even though as you know i was here because i sat in the bureau with you for two hours

it is now up to the commission and our governments to take steps to ensure that crime is fought effectively
what particularly concerns us moreover is that full-time farmers are steadily being replaced by part-timers who cannot guarantee proper levels of professionalism
however be that as it may the matter of transport in particular impacts very much on the general public
but i would like you to agree with me that perhaps we now have here the possibility of a first good step to try and catch up
i will remember that night in berlin as one of the most difficult and lengthiest negotiations i have ever had to conduct
we want not a weaker but a stronger commission
that is where the real achievement lies and they should have been supported
you say you are bombing yugoslavia for ' humanitarian reasons '
as the directive does no more than set minimum standards however we feel that we can go along with the proposed threshold
we want to cure them and the swines are protesting
the european union expects that to mean fair and correct treatment and also a public and constitutional trial before an independent court access to the legal adviser of his choice and admission of international observers to the trial
and first and foremost i should like to say that it is an erroneous definition as it is at odds with declaration 30 that is annexed to the treaty and also goes against common sense itself
in the dutch text there is a very unfortunate mistake or printing error
as a result of petitions the european parliament has had a positive effect on the daily lives of citizens and has been able to act to find a solution to actual cases involving matters within the community remit
we were told yesterday that the german presidency intends to come forward soon with a timetable for the intergovernmental conference

the accident in the channel tunnel - where there is a modern alarm system - could have caused heavy loss of life
the mont blanc accident has cost the lives of forty people and nobody knows when the tunnel will be open to traffic again

moreover interpreting facilities were originally offered for only three target languages to name only one of many other obstacles
the commissioner has just spoken of deepening and strengthening
in short then let us have more people in work in the union and better provision for those taking part in the work process in these member states

it is a pity that they contradict each other
in the course of the discharge proceedings and in the light of the court of auditors ' report we asked a series of very searching questions of the commission
i will fight and vote against asserting something which quite simply is not the case
we need a better structure a better administration and greater transparency
it is not the fault of any of us but we must take that into account
the debate is closed
and you say that we need new scientific data
at this point we were sure that this proposal for a reduced rate of vat would be a useful extra factor and not a short-cut enabling member states to dodge their prime obligation
thank you for the support you have given us this evening
so i think we would be better to cover everything to do with agenda two thousand ninety seven this week and i shall therefore be voting in favor of that
to make any real impact on the unemployment problem and the future of forthcoming generations macro-economic policies must be backed up by an equally far-sighted range of micro-economic measures
the commission 's implementing powers particularly in the area of competition and state aid are considerable and must be exercised independently but also with absolute transparency
democracy 's response to this has been to institute transparency
if i have understood correctly i am being asked whether or not the new commission will include any commissioners from the old one
amendment no 7 simply recalled what happened with regard to the external staff hired by different companies
clearly the storm which swept away the commission in the first part of this year has worried many people
furthermore even in this house some people have said that we could maintain or achieve peace in europe without russia perhaps even if russia were snubbed
we meps are always the best at giving good moral advice but when it comes to seriously looking into a problem we have other things to do
mr president i have every confidence that a solution will soon be found
it is certainly not acceptable for the council to present a proposal to parliament expecting it to be approved
another problem as i see it is that the short period which rapporteurs have to acquaint themselves with the subject matter is scarcely adequate to grasp the complex interrelated issues within the administration
mr prodi also gave an undertaking to this effect in the meeting with the committee chairman so that an appropriate letter of amendment can be presented within this time frame allowing parliament to take it at first reading
unfortunately i believe that the directive has at least one weak point
i should also like to add a personal element here
mr president ladies and gentlemen i too want to begin by thanking you mr president on behalf of the council
no ruler should be able to claim that persecution and murder are a matter of internal policy
all this also brings us up against the question of the constitution we now have and the constitution that we need

how could we be pleased with an agreement that leads to a significant reduction in european farmers ' incomes through a partially compensated reduction in prices before totally eliminating them to satisfy the requirements of the wto

solidarity within the european union and with the pre-accession states the concentrated use of resources job creation less bureaucracy and preparations for enlargement eastward have been the aims of the structural funds reform from the outset

it is up to the democratic institutions to take the decision on whether to participate in this cooperation process
this is true we did see you quite often but that is not the same thing as providing us with information or involving us in the decision making
one of the major problems with the directive is that it is the rules of the country of origin that apply

let me tell you i was in bosnia i saw the mass graves and i will not forget them as long as i live
the commission 's decisions have been nothing but political wheeling and dealing between big states and have no basis in any kind of scientific logic
in view of the great tasks ahead whether it is enlargement the intergovernmental conference or reconstruction in kosovo the european union must be able to act at all levels as soon as possible
therefore i consider that the vote on 15 september will be enormously important
that is why all those engaged in the balkans should also turn their hand to the wheel together with every available support from the european union

madam president the minutes give mrs stenzel as the member of the acp delegation from the delegation of austrian members
but how will legislation be implemented
these issues will form the basis of a report by the committee on constitutional affairs in co-operation with other committees to be prepared over the coming months and which will be submitted to you during a plenary part-session
by addressing the issue of impunity and providing a fair forum for prosecutions the court will help ease international tensions and promote peace and security domestically and internationally

enough of bad dictatorships and good dictatorships of the theory of he 's a son of a bitch but he 's our son of a bitch - if you will excuse me mr president
therefore we have to send out a clear signal
just as we must give unequivocal support to east timor and i support the sanctions and give my signature to and support the resolution so we must also stand by the people of indonesia as a whole
if i recall correctly some of the refugees were actually killed
i think it is quite unreasonable that significant applicable parts of such an agreement should remain outside the public domain

we could parachute certain things in as we do have the necessary military and technical resources
i have the feeling that the incursion against yugoslavia has whet the appetite of those warmongers who want to join the united states of america in its role as the world 's gendarmerie

this is obviously a pandemic that is the primary cause of death for a citizen in an african country
the pharmaceutical industry must no longer be content just to calculate its profit margin in relation to its profitability on western markets alone and must urgently provide poor countries with triple-combination therapy - at cost price too
in this context the imf 's policy of economic restructuring is often cause for fierce and necessary criticism
mr langen 's amendments also received broad-based unanimous support in the committee which is no everyday occurrence
we must bear these costs because they are actually quite modest compared to what is at stake around eur 7 million
inter-regional relationships must also be fostered with south africa a country of regions
the debate is closed
we know in europe small and medium-sized businesses are the bedrock of the economy
you will not be surprised if i tell you that i agree with you entirely mr zabell lucas

why is that

the outcome of these talks is not yet known
it is not acceptable to rob peter to pay paul
there too i think we are demonstrating great pragmatism

mr president adopting the budget for the cultural sector is more difficult than usual this time
the previous commission should have foreseen that the said agreement was going to be discussed again that it was going to be renewed and that therefore it would have to be reflected in the budget

our conclusion then about tampere no doubt some important steps were taken there but these were hardly milestones
we must be particularly vigilant in the next round of preparatory work which must be done openly
we in this parliament hope that those proposals will be on the table very soon
that is not only a question for the european union as an institution but a question of the readiness of the member states to provide our armed forces with the necessary logistical support and reconnaissance
what must it mean
at the time of the first reading the european parliament proposed several amendments
rather it is for us and indeed for governments to see what we can do to help as far as is possible avoid the problem in the first place
i believe that it would not be wise at this stage since we are working on promoting the directive to begin amending it

do you think that these are confidence-building measures
let me just finally address the issue of the precautionary principle you mentioned
that will give us an opportunity to look at the circumstances facing certain member states but for now i think it is absolutely right that we stick to this amendment

we welcome this legislation because it is important that the information outlined is made available to those purchasers for whom environmental and economy considerations are paramount
measures of a non-legislative nature encompass a wide range of activities
secondly simplification
we are indeed making efforts to this effect and as such we are drawing on the original methods used to complete the internal market namely the nineteen ninety two project by lord cockfield
we shall see if we can do something about this
the emphasis on economisation within society and the introduction of market forces into virtually all social fields in particular have a family-unfriendly impact and put humanity under pressure

but at the same different responses are possible within the terms of these regulations and this is what i confirmed to the prime minister of your country mr simitis and to the other government ministers whom i met

so where is the dialogue
yes that means setting up a logical approach in opposition to ecological and social dumping

mr president we have heard a great deal about this new enlargement strategy which mr prodi has also proposed to us in the past
it is an extraordinarily important summit that we - parliament commission and council presidency - have prepared very carefully and vigorously and the challenge of enlargement is an historic challenge of decisive importance
after this we have tried to describe the key players and systems in the eu arena and with regard to international organizations
it found itself in our pigeon-holes today and it was there for debate with the human rights forum which the president referred to
yet we currently have no guarantee that this text will meet expectations
thank you commissioner for your full and documented answer
it ensures that no errors - which the large afforested countries of the north have also experienced - occur
i shall do so

by speeding up the enlargement process the commission has given us the task of speeding up reform
this article ought to be made use of and in general it never is
mr president i would firstly like to congratulate parliament and the commission for having brought the conciliation to a successful conclusion
that is all
i do not doubt that this is far too strict an interpretation of divine will and the people of europe agree
i really would ask the commissioner when he replies to the debate to take this opportunity to clarify as publicly as possible why the european commission has chosen the 1 level
firstly it is not known just how dangerous foodstuffs containing genetically modified organisms or their products are to public health and so it would be well worth monitoring their progress within the market

i have received 14 motions for resolutions in accordance with rule 37 2 to close this debate
the council dropped its earlier estimate of eur 500 million to 360 million
i shall also add that this kind of solution will also reduce sums destined for some priorities that have already been stated specifically for timor which has gone from eur 30 million to eur 20 million
i was obviously speaking about the budget for two thousand ninety nine in which the council 's proposal for compromise involves the use of the flexibility instrument with regard to category 4

does the council intend to take steps to ensure that after a reform of its activities the european court of justice complies with this principle of openness by introducing more transparent decision making
