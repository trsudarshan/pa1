we do endorse and accept the view expressed and are prepared to discuss the matter with the other institutions
we find ourselves in agreement with his report except for the point raised by mr thyssen
i suggest we address this in a practical manner and vote on amendment no 43 in a moment
at this point as the first part has fallen because unfortunately i was not given a chance to speak it is absolutely pointless to take the oral amendment which related to the first part
that is why i have voted in favor mr president
rather than making the institutions and their operation more transparent the function of the ombudsman only serves to conceal the fact they are in no way transparent for the overwhelming majority of the population
mr president in one minute you can say very little but i concur with what mr van orden mrs kinnock and many of the other speakers have said

these include the dublin convention eurodac and rules on safe third countries and safe countries of origin

instead of being delighted about this however mr pirker expresses concern about the fact that the destiny of women from the third world female immigrants who have come from the south is not confined to having children

mr president following the attacks on 11 september it is incumbent upon us to come up with a response appropriate to this tremendous challenge to ensure justice is done and to prevent further attacks

mr president the debate taking place today on the supposed choice between the growth and stability pact and budgetary expansion seems somewhat bizarre
did unemployment have to reach its present rate albeit not as high as just two years ago although it will no doubt rise again commissioner in order to support the euro
what is the point in being dogmatic when you have specific problems and more to the point the problem of a slump in front of you
the stability pact should rather be strengthened improved and made more efficient targets that only refer to budget balances are no longer enough
as the author is not present question no 4 lapses

ninety-five percent of drugs listed as essential drugs by who are off patents and may be produced freely

in this respect the ecb must be more involved
finally i cannot see a role for the european central bank in global crisis prevention
i do not consider it appropriate however to enter into details on specific studies to be carried out and cannot accept this part of the amendment
this brings to light the inefficiency of the new organization of the commission 's functions
a few days after your first reading the overall structure will be in place and the different positions will be known
flexibility and provision for a rapid and appropriate response to new financial demands on the european union and on a common european policy
you have our full backing on everything you have done in getting better information on implementation for us so far
our group has traditionally stressed the importance of preventing unemployment
why has the council with a commission proposal valued at eur 197 million not budgeted for it
i know many of my colleagues in the chamber receive all sorts of letters and e-mails from around europe saying it all must go to this one organization

fr council reform

.

lehne report a5-0380 two thousand ninety nine
or mrs theorin who is chairperson of the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities

i am not aware of any compensation for financial losses due to the closure of us airspace and airports or for the additional security measures that the aviation industry has been expected to put in place
in short the situation is a disgrace not least because job losses outlined two months ago by many businesses are already escalating due to the lack of help
such blind liberalisation will do nothing to advance the cause of the european idea or to increase confidence in europe 's institutions and in our plans for peace and social progress
we will pay the price in europe for that perception
consequently the state aid path is a hard path to tread as things currently stand in europe

it is important for the laeken summit to demonstrate to people that europe is not just about the introduction of the euro

madam president today 's debate is the culmination of a long process which began in the days of the bse epidemic
firstly the regulation will ensure that it will no longer be possible for infected food to be exported to third countries often third world countries

you are a belgian you represent the belgian presidency
i would point out that these explanations have been given since the start of this legislature
secondly your program does not really address the problem that we have in fact implemented very little of the two thousand ninety three program
the percentage of ten activities funded by the general budget is constantly falling while eib loans cover more than three-quarters of the funding in this sector and this is highlighted
in the member states the european public prosecutor would be assisted by ' delegated national prosecutors ' whose responsibilities would have a european dimension

madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the world trade organization has a future
until the end of the negotiating round and therefore until two thousand ninety nine our farmers will have internal aid and restitutions
the countries of the cairns group and the united states saw enshrined in the text the principle of ongoing agricultural reform improved market access and the gradual elimination of export subsidies
in view of this when we put forward our opinion on the amendments adopted we intend also to present a revised financial sheet for that program
moreover we now have an opportunity to examine the degree to which the member states are willing to put justice and home affairs in the forefront of the union 's policies
with that in mind all the member states will have to take global integrated and inter-pillar action
if a problem arises the secretariat-general acts as arbitrator
this is my observation and maybe this may change one day but not in the foreseeable future
there were agreements about this which can in fact only be monitored by finding out exactly how many people have gone back
the eu is therefore opposed to the death penalty in all cases and it has agreed to work towards its universal abolition
the sakharov prize is not enough
this situation is particularly hazardous

so my friends help angola to live
i believe these are not just fears
mr president this is the sixth and most sharply worded motion since the crisis broke in zimbabwe

during the vote on amendment no 2 to the joint resolution on immigration in ireland
mr verhofstadt thank you very much for your marvellous speech
madam president the belgian presidency assumed the presidency of the european union at an extremely crucial time
however we are above all forgetting that the events of 11 september revealed that terrorism is born of and feeds on dictatorships on these dictatorial regimes
we are in favor of an open method we want to give the convention 's hopeful method a chance we want to throw open the doors to let a fresh breeze in
i think i have responded as fully as possible to the list of interventions which the prime minister has not yet been able to reply to
the laeken declaration is a successful mixture of questions regarding problems to be solved and on the other hand faith in being able to solve them
but what sort of president would slow down or increase the pace of the votes depending on how this could affect the outcome
i should like to share a story with you which is not classically parliamentary but nonetheless has a connection and meaning for me on this day of all days
this was precisely the point that was raised in the question of how we should vote
in december two thousand eighty two we achieved great progress in this area
firstly we will promote the connection and opening up of european transport and communications systems
we need an integrated strategy for community-level education and research based on networking and mobility and giving priority to the technologies of the future to biotechnology and clean technologies for example

his saying that is wholly unacceptable
enlargement has now entered a crucial phase

competition has also correspondingly become more intense which has necessarily also led to the tendency for safety and work conditions to lose out in many businesses
repas will be based on regional integration strengthening and deepening the existing regional integration initiatives
we abstained from voting on this report
it is i think highly significant that the majority position adopted in the committee on industry external trade research and energy was that space activities should only be intended for peaceful purposes
for reasons of competitive neutrality the european union legislative framework for banks and investment firms is based on the principle of equality of treatment between competing institutions at least as regards certain business and market segments
on this question i will communicate with the relevant irish authorities and will raise the matter with the european commission
mr bush talks of an axis of evil between iran iraq and north korea and has said that he is keeping open all his options for making the usa and its allies safe

all those actions have resulted in further searches the arrest of some of those responsible and the confiscation of documents and equipment
fortunately we are now in a position where we can welcome a second very important directive on the organization of working times

mr president all those taking part in the summit must ensure that it is a success
on the proposal for a council framework decision on the european arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between the member states 14867 1 01 - c5-0675 two thousand ninety three - two thousand ninety three 0215 cns
the pure hypocrisy of this statement is highlighted by the fact that the framework decisions deal a very severe blow to democracy and collective and individual social rights
we must therefore take a firm decision to strengthen the role of the parliamentary institution in the union 's structure to further parliamentarise the union supplementing the progress achieved during the 90s
the report concludes again quite rightly that there is a risk of a growing democratic deficit
well then i believe that the undertakings assumed by the council are important but that alongside them there should also be constant protection in individual cases
i should therefore like to welcome the conclusions of that summit and call on the council and the commission to take them into consideration
this has already been decided in the report by mrs langenhagen as she herself has just pointed out and i myself gave a favourable opinion on behalf of the committee on industry external trade research and energy
there is currently a mobilisation in my country because it appears that the execution has been brought forward to this saturday

this does not apply to a large-scale project that has partly been funded with tax money and that can only win or lose
this project is a perfect illustration of one of the domains in which european cooperation is vital
hermange report a5-0009 two thousand seventy five
the decision by the us to classify them in this way is therefore not vindictive but practical and necessary but it exposes the inadequacy of the anachronistic international jurisprudence in this area
as far as the third area is concerned what is happening at eurotunnel demonstrates the urgent need to harmonise europe 's asylum policy
thirdly we must rethink community policies
no action can be totally efficient under the current constraints in other words we are wasting resources

this system of indicators must obviously be integrated into the way in which the development of economic and social policy is measured
we have such high regard for the us that we need to make this appeal in a proper manner
mr president i should like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur for this report which concludes the budget discharge for nineteen ninety nine
but to be honest it is not enough
because what is important to us is the outcome of these programs
for society
the sitting was closed at 12.11
this extremely serious strategic about-turn goes hand-in-hand with the already exaggerated increase of the us military budget an increase equivalent to the total amount of official development assistance of all the oecd countries
the commission will do all it can to present you with an initial analysis on the feasibility of this project by the end of the year
we should not forget however that the weight limit proposed by the commission was 50 grammes
it established their roles and responsibilities - inquiries advice and consultancy regulation settlement of disputes - and the procedures for their appointment
i hope that we shall support transparency and that here in parliament we shall at least be able to question those proposed for the office in question
all of this should be reviewed mr president
consequently we have of course voted against the report
what happened in afghanistan with the rise of the taliban is one very typical example
as ' prevention is better than cure ' a worker whose noise exposure exceeds the lower exposure action values will also be entitled to appropriate audiometric testing
i think the figures speak for themselves
the common position has come up with a compromise here that i entirely support
safety must be the main concern
we are speaking about products that are on the market today and are asking why we need to provide evidence of their safety
all this should be totally acceptable to the honest players and even directly to their advantage
whilst the directive will help guarantee access to the markets for all manufacturers parliament has been especially keen to take account of the problems of small manufacturers
the european union has already been responsible for the closure of many slaughterhouses and in fact in many cases there would be no space for separate sewage treatment facilities
but commissioner the commission also considered that their behavior towards the european parliament was unsatisfactory since the information we were provided with was insufficient and in some cases wrong
current estimates also put the cost of implementing this one directive in the applicant countries at about eur 30 billion
we think that the reports should be written in a way that is easy to understand and that they should be accessible to the public
the commission has already over the past year set out its thinking on the issues to be dealt with and emphasised its willingness to enter into dialogue
finally i believe the issue of eastwards enlargement should lead us to reflect on the kind of europe we are aiming for
i believe that from this perspective answers need to be forthcoming
our policy in these matters remains clear we need to respect the international rules
in other words i do not approve the oral amendment
if there are 12 members standing their places against an oral amendment then it cannot be put
this is a good initiative
i have always attached great importance to health and consumer protection
question no 2 by alexandros alavanos h-0063 02
that is ultimately what will determine how we vote on this issue and i hope i can give it my approval
indeed a certain degree of harmonisation in that area has already taken place
i will only mention some of them such as a specific instrument to contribute to democracy the democratic bonus financial or material aid to improve the functioning of democratically elected parliaments and a better representation of the opposition
the joint parliamentary assembly has adapted its work according to the new role that it has been given in particular to promote democratic processes
we are of course in favor of direct aid to projects on the ground
in this respect support for elections and increasing institutional capacity at the different levels of decision-making and administration are essential
thirdly tobacco production generates more employment and stimulates more economic activity than many other agricultural practices such as meat production
commissioner you stated that the commission is proposing certain measures and alternative employment opportunities in the context of rural development
the vote will take place today at 12 noon
why a year
first of all i should like to congratulate the commissioner on the fact that he has succeeded in reaching an agreement within the framework of gabon at a time when it is increasingly difficult to conclude fisheries agreements
i think it is wrong to vote on such a technical text at such short notice which is why i have serious reservations about voting on it now
it is unacceptable socially because it disadvantages tens of thousands of tobacco-growing families in the poorest areas of the european union who are unable to grow alternative crops
the commission proposal is promising
the united states has no hesitation in violating any agreements made in order to defend their interests
mr president once again we are talking about colombia a dearly loved country on the american continent but regrettably once again we are doing so because of the negative issues affecting it

that is underlined here with broad strokes of the pen

it is easy to feel powerless faced with the fact that so many people need this protection but also faced with the inability we have in many quarters to integrate asylum seekers and immigrants into our member states
president cox was also affected by this incident as you know
we shall therefore pass on your complaint to all those responsible for this incident to prevent it from happening again

i am concerned at some suggestions that export refunds should be ended and i reject any notion that export refunds are somewhat inherently conducive to fraud
paragraphs 25 and 33 however seem to insidiously call into question the provisions of the treaty
it is still unsatisfactory that the problem of budgeting for agencies ' income could not be resolved as the committee on budgetary control would wish
why is that
this provides a mechanism for developing closer co-operation in the fields of police and judicial activities in the areas of criminal law
abbreviated pursuant to rule 137 of the rules of procedure
i am nonetheless aware of the fact that the proposal concerns an area covered by title iv of the treaty establishing the european community and does not apply to denmark cf.the protocol on denmark 's position

following the repeated statements by president bush which have not yet led to any action there is no other way
this is our second attempt and i hope and trust that this time we will have a community patent
this can be achieved firstly by using the language regime of three working languages of the european patent office which since it guarantees the threshold of international competitiveness meets our specific linguistic needs
of course not they should achieve the targets and if they comply with those targets and rates and guidelines then they should be able to keep their financing systems over a period of about 10 years

if this were true the 200 000 refugees in ingushetia would no longer be alive
mr president the valencia summit is most likely to be remembered just for having been held
china is a very important trading partner for the eu not least for my own country finland
were the socialist group 's amendments to be included it would indeed be almost perfect
a policeman has even had a letter published stating that the right to demonstrate is written into china 's constitution and that it needs therefore to become easier to obtain permission to demonstrate
china 's accession to the wto will further improve the terms for capital recovery
an entirely different goal would be necessary in order to achieve modernisation that takes in to account developments in work and life stages and to create a genuine right to gradual retirement
it is very important that the member states that have responsibility for pension schemes bear in mind the needs of citizens who use their european rights to work and retire in different countries of the union
as i see it there are three flaws in this otherwise excellent report
we must be aware that they suffer a glaring lack of equity capital and that even the banks there find this very difficult

a guarantee must be given to the international community and at the same time israel must not see this as a hostile act
i have been in palestine dozens of times since nineteen sixty eight and have seen countless bombed palestinian houses
it really is high time that we in the eu took a fairly tough line and at least fulfilled the pretty mild demand made by the european parliament namely that we suspend the association agreement with israel
last week he imprisoned a leader marwan barghouti who has been one of the main people behind the demand for peace
at valencia we attempted at last to give a sign that the union is present to make it clear that it is now time for action that the time has passed for argument and declarations
well then the situation will soon be beyond humanitarian aid
what initiative can europe the european union pursue
that led to the creation of budgetary chapter b7-700 now known as the european initiative for democracy and human rights
the problem in this field is obvious to everyone
the annual report may well also contribute towards this and the program of action also makes available resources for measures to raise awareness
this instrument introducing measures to protect workers from risks in the workplace arising from vibration represents an important step in the improvement of workers ' health and safety
politically speaking it would be unacceptable if this communication by the bbc were true and if a presidency could block or delay the presentation of proposals by the commission
i feel that this is the way to go for it will enable parliament to fully exploit new technologies to publicise its work
the directive provides for a period of fourteen days
this is of course not the first time that we are arguing in parliament about these two principles
again i must disagree with these proposed amendments
the committee on employment and social affairs believes that we need to use this advantage every way we can at both european and national level
unless this happens the very development of the economy and the tourism of these regions will in the medium term be irremediably compromised
various assessments have shown that the tempus program is perceived as an invaluable means of fostering mutual understanding
mr president ladies and gentlemen i see both light and shade in the outcome of the legislative process which is now drawing to its close on the caudron report and on the sixth framework program
we must continue with these efforts
this is what both researchers and european citizens will thank us for
how many people will be inclined to sit at their computer and watch such broadcasts
how many regions of europe have experienced greater development due to a network of high speed trains due to a new motorway a more modern port or an airport
is it really necessary - as is stated in the text - to prioritise the reduction of outgoings or can we not change the revenue side by means of tax justice
ladies and gentlemen kaliningrad will prove to be either a positive or negative example of relations between the eu and russia one that will either take the form of cooperation or mean problems
however it will not be possible for any instructions to be given to the commission
it is highly regrettable that there have been communication problems and that mr schmidt was only informed of the commission 's decision at such short notice
with regard to the budget the funding allocated to these structural funds is eur 739 million at nineteen ninety six prices which is an average of eur 125 million per year
increases in investment of 4 were possible in the usa during the 1990s with a significant impact on growth and employment
a target of 3 needs to be introduced for stability programs here
for the first time a report has been presented that is not purely of a general nature but which employs the technique of tabling amendments to the commission 's recommendation
food production in europe is very diverse and it is therefore necessary for the regulations to permit a certain degree of flexibility
the first of these is that exceptions should only be granted if the animal disease situation does not prevent it and if it would in no way adversely affect the level of protection against animal diseases

i come now to the regulation on the control of salmonella and other zoonotic agents
for these reasons and for consistency i reject amendments nos 3 and 37
until nineteen ninety nine relations between the european union latin america and the caribbean had been based on a mainly sub-regional approach
that should also give us food for thought for strategic planning
the rotation of the presidencies is the most democratic thing about the eu
where competences are shared it is important indeed that in all those areas where local knowledge ought to prevail local knowledge does prevail
the amendments tabled by mr wurtz and mr sakellariou are very much to be supported
the judiciary needs to be re-established and frameworks created for the new administration all without the necessary financial resources
the commission rightly identifies what it calls a global governance gap with global market forces running far ahead of the ability of institutional mechanisms to contain them
it is more important than ever to pitch community policy in such a way that companies are able to comply with it and so that it is also more advantageous for them to do so
in german it says here that the union 's own competences must remain limited
mr president we may not be many but i am sure we are good
however i must say that we are far from the 0.7 that we committed to and which we cannot give up on
it is not just a question of a casual street brawl but orchestrated violence and intimidation over a sustained period
what is more you allow the scandalous squandering of over a million tonnes of fish which one member state destroys each year to convert into animal feed without asking how this affects the food chain of the species
they are not asking you for more money mr fischler but rather to carry on fishing
we believe that in the uk consumers have paid too much for their cars for too long and this parliament should not postpone the cheaper car prices which will be the result of a more competitive market
for example on the one hand the report calls for a system of direct aid not linked to production but on the other hand it calls for production-related aid to be increased in various areas
the commission can accept amendments nos 22 28 30 32 33 42 45 and 46 in their entirety
furthermore it appears that a number of important assessment aspects have been overlooked
he has produced a product which i use myself called armilatox which is the only effective way of treating plant diseases like honey fungus
if we do not do that in this very important area we will have failed
the good cause is not served by duplication
the distribution of tasks must be clear
the part of the amendment that we have just adopted provides for member state exemptions in the processing of personal information
madam president this is important for all our citizens but we have also experienced difficulties in our own work in parliament as a result of spam mail
it is nevertheless welcome as there are some important issues which at least have had an airing and which we can hopefully pursue further in johannesburg
applause
on monday i have no proposals for change
what have been its findings
that is why the proposal is rightly made to give the committee on budgets and the committee on legal affairs and the internal market greater responsibility for compatibility with the budget and with the law
this goes for ourselves in our capacities as candidates by the way
that wording is one on which we may request a split vote and vote against
i hope that the commission will work a miraculous transformation and support most of them
the proposed solution to ban animal testing within the eu whenever possible and to make mandatory use of all alternative methods at the earliest opportunity seemed an improvement
and even greater efforts can be made especially with regard to public assistance
we must be careful also to focus on the broader picture
it is then our desire that a commission proposal on this topic be submitted as early as this summer
this is what links the proposals on council reform made by mr solana in his report and the proposals of the commission on better regulation
mr president you will have noticed that i do not always have a high opinion of the functioning of the council
mr president i would like to welcome mr prodi and thank him for his words
i believe therefore that this is a successful result and i should like to thank all those who took part in this work
parliament adopted the decision
the commission will have to pay a heavy price for refusing to take these warnings seriously
this is primarily the case because of the disastrous environmental damage that was caused as a result of the erika tanker sinking of the coast of france a couple of years ago
in any event we have succeeded which has made me very happy and i am very pleased that i will be able to continue to do this over the next two years
it is precisely because of the tragedies which have marked europe in very different ways that there is only one reasonable way forward the way of reconciliation

let me add that everyone involved should work towards ensuring that the outcome is capable of securing a majority in both the current eu and the new member states
we must simplify the procedures and trust in the executors
the rural development measures must ensure that there are active rural areas with diversified production in the candidate countries and especially that they guarantee employment
after much deliberation i too will oppose amendment no 2 as i realize this would pose problems to the council by considerably reducing the application of the directive
amendment no 13 can be accepted except for the reference to cn code 3814 0090 in the definition of non-agricultural alcohol because that code covers mixtures of alcohol with solvents and is not limited to non-agricultural alcohol
i come from a culture where self-regulation is very common
they are the section of our economy that we need to promote as stated at the lisbon summit but we need to act quickly because our slowness is suffocating them
that is absolutely important
democracy is not a one-way process as it can easily be on the web
we are of course aware of the serious problems involved in realizing structural and regional policy and see the commission and the member states as sharing responsibility
b5-0368 two thousand ninety eight submitted by mr collins on behalf of the union for europe of the nations group on the situation in nepal
we voted in favor of it in the committee
a driving ban however useful it may be has a drastic effect on the principle of the free movement of goods and hits the peripheral countries the hardest
i am therefore replying to the question by mr jarzembowski and i thank him for his support
in order to meet the commitments made by the union in kyoto we must contemplate using at least in part fuels that do not exacerbate the greenhouse effect as a substitute for fossil fuels

the directive will be important for the sector 's industry and will point the way to developments in the years to come
unlike the commissioner i believe that the best way to safeguard nuclear materials is to stop production of them and a particular issue is the reprocessing of nuclear materials
indeed the trans-european networks are very closely linked to the revision of the cohesion policy and enlargement
to put it another ways budgetary consolidation second only to the maintenance of price stability as a primary objective of european economic policy is in danger
the president cut the speaker off
a debate has ensued in the swedish parliament about legal certainty in conjunction with the adoption of a european arrest warrant
do you believe that this will be a long-term conflict with the us or are you hopeful that the countermeasures currently planned by the european union will lead to the americans coming to their senses
consequently for these reasons we do not accept this proposal and have no alternative but to vote against it
i understand that matter is already being taken care of by the services
number one respect for difference - that is what all conflict is about
the european institutions however are too closely linked to the business community and its interests to exert any real pressure on it in any domain whatsoever
we also voted in favor of amendment no 7 which clearly explains our position
in most eu member states there is already an arrangement in place by means of which a pregnancy which is not wanted by the woman can be terminated on her initiative in a medically responsible manner
this is a concrete commitment and so these accusations are decidedly off-target
i should like however to say that even though it is a major problem and a difficult situation we shall not in my view achieve anything by describing the american bill as a threat to transatlantic relations
the european union is fortunately a staunch supporter of the criminal court but the united states is its most radical opponent
mr president-in-office what you said was perfectly clear
we were disturbed when we saw the draft to find that this directive discriminated against this important category of machinery
there are lots of horror stories presented by the press to misinform people
europe can only protect itself through the law using sanctions and prosecutions
the administrative procedures need to be improved
informal contacts with the commission suggest that there has been better reporting for two thousand ninety eight
that was how it put it
i congratulate my friend and colleague mrs gillig as rapporteur
the council cannot confirm it orally as you requested for it is not here but the commission is here and is able to give us its opinion of these amendments
many people in the european union - and certainly many of my own constituents - have had serious complaints about fraudulent behavior and mistreatment at the hands of sharks operating in this market
it is a peace-building method which encourages the emerging administration and closer collaboration with regional and local administrations
mr president in europe over the past few days large so-called ' gay pride demonstrations have been held
the country is and has long been isolated
i think it is time for such a dialogue as a focus for the good forces of moderation and moderate people
mr president after a delay of one year the european commission 's proposal to amend the packaging and packaging waste directive is finally before us
they fail to take specific geographical and demographic problems into account
however developments in this area are mainly determined by the tax situation for biofuels
turning specifically to protein crop production let me remind you that we propose introducing a separate supplementary aid of eur 55.57 per hectare
and in fact the proposal adds little in the field of safety
airspace is not only used by civilians but also by the military and cooperation between the two is therefore necessary
i will deliberately emphasise that this must be quick and indeed immediate
we do however have a responsibility
this must happen as part of an overall agreement concerning the two thousand ninety six budget
we sympathise with the problems that morocco has to face we want to help morocco deal with those economic and social problems and we support the efforts it has made not least in the area of gender
it is funded by the life quality control of infectious diseases program

the success of this program is clearly expressed in the large number of projects that have been submitted
iraq continues to make new demands and to lay down further conditions and it still refuses to give the weapons inspectors free and unconditional access
the european union welcomes the security council 's adoption of resolution 1409 of 14 may two thousand ninety six which significantly eases the united nations sanctions on iraq
are they also tomorrow 's enemies however
should this ultimatum be set by the un
they are all questions to which we will have to find our own answers over the coming weeks and months
there is nonetheless a long way to go before there can again be talk of a stable afghanistan
preparations for implementation of this program are well advanced
i sincerely wish president karzai and ex-king mohammad zahir shah well with all the challenging problems that they face in the months to come
i will now turn briefly to mr maaten 's report which is of course an excellent one
asia is not only huge in terms of area
more cooperation is needed in this area
mr president as mr pirker pointed out i had the honor to lead the european parliament 's delegation to the asep ii meeting in the philippines last week
the eu is involved then but it is the un that is responsible for actually carrying out the work
question no 3 by liam hyland which has been taken over by mr crowley h-0527 02
the union 's document base must be made accessible to the public in all the official languages and free of charge and the development of interactive portals must be promoted
we do have something to add however to the discussion particularly when the convention is up and running and the future of europe and institutional reform are being so widely debated
this would create a connection between europe and the people of europe
secondly the public must receive inter alia information about the right to participate in decision-making in the forms and quantities permitted - we touched on this just now
mrs oomen-ruijten then referred to a number of points that i would like to take up
this type of training is usually available in the big cities
i am afraid i must point out on the basis of this analysis that much of the research funded was then subcontracted precisely to university researchers for its implementation
the eu is playing with fire
some are more important and more justified than others it is true
this joint consideration of two equally important and sensitive dossiers gives the impression that asylum seekers are potential terrorists
there is an issue which we know is controversial and which is going to cause difficulties the export to third-world countries of genetically modified organisms which are not accepted in the european union
the present text helps the member states to make every effort to prevent unintentional transboundary movement of gmos
we must comply with what the protocol requires of us but we may according to the protocol go further if we wish
secondly these are technical amendments and there is no justification for making substantive changes at this point
i reject the proposal but endorse the proposals to better protect personal data inform parliament and place reports in the public domain
one the principle of prevention needs to be clearly stated in the community text
what if we had been born in one of the countries from which these people are forced to emigrate to come to europe and make a living '
i think this situation is open to severe criticism
the northern dimension also offers immense scope for cooperation in the field of cultural and research policy and higher education
we emphasise that half way through the period up to two thousand ninety four there should be a thorough audit and investigation of what has been achieved
thus as always the commission is looking for a european problem that does not exist on a european level and then failing to address it
what does it really mean
the presidency attaches great importance to effective follow-up of both the internal and the global dimension of the eu 's obligations for bringing about sustainable development
the world is in a state of emergency in both the environmental and the social fields and so achieving a merely reasonable result at the summit was not acceptable to this parliament
we agree however that it is legitimate to expect more than what was achieved
a green label for sustainable timber and a red label for incorrectly produced timber
governments have a duty to deal with this by supplementing existing legislation with means of protection other than conventional asylum
nonetheless in order to combat unemployment in the member states european governments need to learn from each other coordinate their approaches and exchange best practices
but despite the progress on the reform agenda the humanitarian and economic situation continues to deteriorate
the positive elements of european foreign policy include a topic that we have not yet mentioned at all that is the accession of the central european countries to the european union
i should above all like to focus on the bottleneck caused by failure to implement various regulations the first one being the code of conduct
thirdly a balance in relations between the centres of power on the world map
most of us share this objective although it is felt particularly strongly as you would expect by those member states such as my own portugal that have special cultural historical and linguistic links with these countries
some amendments concern the need to improve and harmonise the quality of fuel used in non-road mobile machinery throughout the community
the network is up and running and is constantly improving and i therefore feel that access must be further facilitated
the common agricultural policy still works on the basis of productivist thinking by multiplying surpluses
we do not want to jump the gun
we need to discuss thursday afternoon 's agenda
mr president i think there are more fundamental questions to be asked following on from what our colleague said
in discussing further reform in the cap we must ensure that the accession countries are involved in an advisory capacity as soon as possible
mr president the debate on iraq you provided us with last month in strasbourg made us fear the worst namely war
we could not seriously however tell the world today that tomorrow we will be able to capture mullah omar or osama bin laden on babylonian soil
superimposed on this was a footprint of buckingham palace
secondly it must lay down limits down to the last detail on how far we can go in controlling saddam hussein 's arsenal
or is the focus in respect of these inherently sound intentions on the social directives
this agreement sends a strong signal of the solidarity of european citizens with the algerian people
it is a key point because the situation in algeria has been extraordinarily troubled for at least a decade
we tried to do this several times in equatorial africa - formerly under belgian control - and extended these efforts to the neighbouring countries of the gulf of guinea which has such substantial oil reserves
your visit raised their hopes that in such a case the eu would intervene
the danger is that production will move somewhere else where it will cause more pollution
we will achieve no positive outcome on a worldwide basis and that is why we are in favor not only of fair conditions but also of letting the instruments compete until the kyoto protocol takes effect
the question of a revision therefore arises and we know that this is a debate that has caused much concern including when the work of the previous convention was concluded
it benefits the individuals our society and their country of origin on return and by meeting basic social needs we can avoid larger social costs
this text constantly seeks to broaden the definition of refugees provided by the geneva convention
i am thinking of additional studies and of academic credit systems
culture surely has a huge role to play in this respect
let me start with the objectives of the proposals
this report highlights some considerable challenges
firstly i would like to warn against the commission 's proposals under article 67 that all veterinary medicines intended for food-producing animals should be available on prescription only
the compromises reached in the committee on the environment actually manage to reflect the specific nature of the european social model which attempts to ally social issues with competition
mr president the effective new medicines have brought about a major revolution in healthcare
we can therefore accept amendment no 92 in principle but we still retain our right to look at the duration of that additional protection
it is right that people are against the american direct-to-consumer advertising
some amendments relate to relative effectiveness
i propose that we proceed as we have done on other occasions with regard to the financial regulation in other words that we vote on the text of the amendments but postpone the vote on the legislative proposal
moreover several statements have been made about tax policy an outstanding example of a policy that should take shape close to the people that is to say in the member states
we have been able to tackle a number of points ourselves by improving the internal work of parliament itself
these are long-term tasks
i should likewise like to thank the chairman of the committee on budgets terence wynn
i do not just mean the commission and the council but colleagues from a variety of parliamentary committees
mr president i would like to thank the rapporteurs the chairman of the committee on budgets and the commissioner
i would add something further
it is linked to conditions which the council can fulfil by the end of the year so as not to jeopardise enlargement
i wish to do the same and highlight one small point one that mrs buitenweg has already mentioned
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i should like firstly to express warm thanks to the rapporteur mr stenmarck
i have to tell the rapporteur that i cannot however accept that discharge should be deemed to have been granted if in april the plenary rejects a proposal from the committee on budgetary control that it be deferred
attention has been drawn to the human resources cutbacks
now some specific comments
de mr president i would like to return to some of the points that have been made
this separation of the functions is important
the decisions that remain will not be easy
mr president ask a leading question and you get the answers you are looking for
this position outlined by president prodi needs to become a major effort to bridge the gap between northern and southern europe
as to whether any head of a member state 's government can be found willing to do that i have serious doubts
looking at the conditions on this border you cannot actually believe that easier access is the real issue
that concludes the explanations of vote
it is not enough to introduce new technologies you have to provide further training for staff as well
not only in the fight against terrorism and international crime but also as a key element in the development of our own european security policy
at the eu-ukraine summit held in copenhagen in july two thousand ninety nine ukraine was offered eu neighbouring country status
at this eu-russia summit could you not put on the agenda the fact that the european institutions wish to visit chechnya to see the situation there for themselves
our proposal will also eliminate the restrictions of the current regulation
only in exceptional cases can public sector aid be granted to the private sector
so thank you for involving us from the outset
.
lies i suppose
i think it would be far better if the commission were to keep its paper in the pending tray for another year so that the threshold values can be adjusted to the regulations currently on the agenda
that is specifically ruled out
this has nothing to do with the provision of article 50 1
it would be completely schizophrenic on the one hand to say that we want to see a strongly critical resolution in the un and on the other hand to enter into a trade agreement with the same country
we shall take note of what has been achieved
finally i wish to speak particularly for my constituents in east anglia many of whom have not drawn on the common agricultural policy because they grow crops which have never been subsidised by this union
let us also not forget this issue in international relations
furthermore this step should not cause production prices to fall
where nuts are concerned the producer countries clearly expressed a need for special subsidies in this sector
in this case as we have been hearing we are looking at a national situation in which historical anomalies and to some extent theological anomalies have led to an unacceptable situation which has already been clearly outlined
.
- da firstly we should like it to be noted that we strongly support revision of eu agricultural policy that is to say the actual aim of the report
it already looks close to impossible even without adding another report
for a fee the organization trees for travel plants trees after each plane trip you make
this ambivalent situation needs to be borne in mind by everyone championing more effective ways of protecting health from the spread in the use of tobacco which unfortunately does not have its own article in the treaty
indeed as the commissioner himself admitted with great frankness a few minutes ago the commission 's latest proposal is decidedly inadequate to provide the kind of protection of public health demanded by the committee on the environment
madam president i would like to begin by echoing the comments made by my fellow members from galicia and to say that i shall support all their initiatives
we have a common agricultural policy
i have always believed that turkey 's accession would provide an important bridgehead between the west and the islamic world
this brings me to the final problem that being that the eu 's internal decision-making process is far from structured
this is reflected in the annexes
they want to become part of the european family and are ready to make a great deal of effort to accomplish that
unfortunately sea does not yet cover eu-financed plans and programs but the commission has promised that this must happen something for which parliament has expressed its support
i will say something about that in a moment
europe has no reason to exist if its union does not strengthen its members
i am pleased that he has been present in person throughout the part-session which demonstrates respect towards parliament
he said that the danish presidency had raised the situation in chechnya both fully and forcefully at the summit with russia
i would like to end by thanking parliament for having raised the issue of social dialogue and the tripartite social summit
however in order to ensure the safety of these substances i propose that current authorisations be reviewed within four years of the entry into force of the regulation
i trust that this will be included in the record for this sitting
laying down harmonised rules and procedures will facilitate the cross-border trade in herbal medicines which currently is very limited
no extract-specific data are required in this type of evidence
however certain amendments mean that temporary workers would not benefit from these same conditions until they had worked in the company for six weeks six months or even 12 months
this scope was very restricted in the proposal for a directive because it only applied to restrictions or prohibitions on certain groups of workers or certain sectors
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
furthermore it reinforces the dependency of farmers and of member states ' food policies on the multinationals
it is not for the commission to define these on its own it must be done by politicians in general
bans on cigarette machines and rules governing gifts and self-service in shops are better drawn up at national level
the meeting made good progress on a number of technical issues such as monitoring and reporting and paved the way for the use of the clean development mechanism cdm
tomorrow will i have to go back and say to them ' we are moved very moved but we cannot be effective in less than three years because of codecision '
the indignation is growing by the hour
but the problem is not with any particular port
was it some secretary
it is no secret that the final negotiations will not be easy
they are a necessary part of enlargement as a whole
where must our borders end
evidently we also need to talk to each other
it could be that we want to raise an issue about the legality of current proposals under the primary law relating to the accession of spain and portugal
i am also willing to fund further research work to help us find even better ways to rescue this fishery
member states will have to coordinate their control activities and member states ' inspectors will be able to make controls across borders
we are unashamedly promoting our shipbuilding industry and constructing double-hulled oil tankers that will ply the seas more safely following the example of the united states
there are simply too many vessels for too few fish and there are unreasonably large discrepancies between the ways in which the member states have so far administered fisheries policy
decisions and objectives of the recovery plans cannot discard the social and economic consequences which they may have
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i represent a country of whose history fishing and the sea are an integral part and in which the fisheries sector still provides around fifty thousand jobs
amendment no 1 is particularly important to me and i therefore hope that reason will prevail over emotion tomorrow for no 1 is of fundamental importance for the protection of human health itself
it was in mid-september and in this chamber that by far the most important conference on the subject of trafficking in human beings to date was organised by the international organization for migration and the european commission
naturally we need bilateral police cooperation worthy of the name
according to an estimate by the international organization for migration trafficking in human beings affects between 700 000 and two million women and children throughout the world every year
we must not advocate a return to populism
we believe in democracy
.because your giving us milk and wheat represents unfair competition for peruvian farmers
we have already allocated this time to other issues including the one on which we have just voted
we are therefore attempting to amend certain articles of the schengen convention in the aim of giving it new functions
we will therefore be complying with the provisions of article 31 of the european union 's charter of fundamental rights
i opposed this
with regard to legislation since nineteen seventy two we have legislation in place at eu level in respect of imports of commercial products
pt the final report is to be welcomed because it upholds the current restrictive list of products
my constituents expect no less
in these areas europe is indeed the largest donor
enlargement is the hallmark of next year 's budget
the european commission should exercise more restraint in such questions
this shows that considerable progress has been made in bringing the old ex ante controls into the services ' internal control procedures
the standards in question are in fact very new
during those visits the moroccan authorities expressed their political determination and firm commitment to cooperate with the union in the fight against illegal immigration and on border controls in particular
it is not just a question of supplying some hardware here and there
the member states can decide that individually
we are not top of the class in the environmental field but as regards waste prevention and waste recycling we are
for economic reasons we ignored this danger for a long time and today tens of thousands of victims are suffering and dying
while the european union has been developing at high speed turkey has remained trapped in the disadvantages of its kemalist system a system with great internal tensions and therefore with widespread repression
the subject of our work over recent days was a common vision for the future of our continent
the ec treaty specifies that the european system of central banks shall have price stability as its principal objective
how much longer are we going to wait
copenhagen has said the same thing and i hope that this time it will be done
it is important that the deadlines are met
certainly more could have been done
in this respect i shall respond to mrs boumediene-thiery and say that the commission has no executive responsibilities in the area of return
i have received from the commission a proposal relating to these events for a regulation instituting specific measures to compensate the spanish fisheries shellfish industry and aquaculture affected by the oil spills from the prestige
conservation programs such as the life and natura two thousand seventy five programs for example also have damaging consequences for economic activity
between 5 and 7 of the european citizens live in mountain regions on average
it is no good being in the audience
his colleague lobsang dhondup also faces a death penalty without reprieve
it is evident that neither of the two defendants received a fair trial
the good thing about the report however is that it identifies a whole series of infringements such as the torture of prisoners trafficking in human beings and the suppression of rights in genoa

when you want unity you do not start nor should you start with what divides you you start with what unites you
that saddam hussein 's regime is a threat to world peace cannot be disputed given the facts

that was a pity because it has meant that up to now it has been virtually impossible to arrive at compromises and to create broader support
mr president like other members here today i have been lobbied extensively about this directive and i have been impressed by the degree of support - or at least the support in principle - for it

if in this parliament we raise expectations for citizens and petitioners that we cannot meet we do so at our peril
however we do not know at this moment who is right
obviously ladies and gentlemen the commission does not have the resources to cover such needs and can only support a small number of centres each year
i hope they will sign it
this will make it possible to mobilise far greater private sector resources
this is why i wish briefly to respond to some points

an important element is access to the market
in principle some might view this as a positive development since it could provide the uk with new market opportunities in other member states

russia is suffering to a quite substantial degree from remilitarisation and the return of elements from the secret services developments that also essentially derive from chechnya and the war that is being waged there
you must not hesitate in this area gentlemen
the violence of resistance and that of oppression cannot however be directly compared with one another because they are two different things

as such use of new technology may require very substantial investment however sufficient funding must be provided in the community budget and support must be given to member states needing it
hypocritical and groundless arguments are being used to wipe out olive oil farming
so this debate has not come about all of a sudden it has not just landed in our laps we have been considering it for years and you in parliament have been discussing it for years
the following changes have been proposed
that does not mean there is no room for improvement
commissioner permit me to put your comments in a context less formal than this one
at a time when we are on the verge of enlargement and we need more information than ever i think such repercussions are definitely out of place
a reference to christian roots in the preamble to the constitution would have a unifying and symbolic meaning because modern europe was formed on the basis of specific values
all i can say is that we will redouble our efforts to try to ensure that we support her in overcoming those obstacles and moving the social agenda forward
in this area there is of course also a very important role for the political parties the european parliament and the non-governmental organizations

the first is the new member states
this is the most difficult point of the entire strategy

indeed they have spoken about fiscal ' sovereignty '
anyone who is the commission president always acts on behalf of all europeans
who is taking responsibility for ensuring that all the documents in proof now come to light

had this been the case the eurostat issue would not have occurred on this scale
president prodi let me warn you most urgently not to create even more bodies but instead to strengthen the ones we have and implement reforms where these are needed

this is the custom in the house it is common law
the urgent need for strategic action to combat cancer at european level is demonstrated by the alarming etiological fact that one european in four has or will have a malignant tumor in the course of their lives
we must not give in to those member states that are failing to invest sufficiently in this
firstly the establishment of standards at eu level through the extension of the ipc directive secondly the establishment of guidelines regarding sham recovery and thirdly clearer distinctions between the different recovery and disposal operations
it was certainly a valuable occasion for an extensive exchange of views on international issues
the commission welcomes that because it will encourage cooperation in fighting terrorism and organised crime
the northern dimension environmental partnership which is coordinated by the european bank for reconstruction and development is an excellent tool
the european union therefore has an obligation to promote these attempts at approximation with the aim of ensuring the interoperability of means both at intra-european and transatlantic levels in order to avoid pointless and wasteful duplication and overlapping
i believe that the crucial issue facing us consists of recognizing the advantages of the schengen information system
it would be facile to see nafta as canada 's surrender to economic destiny
we cannot accept the idea that european citizenship is all well and good as long as the citizens do not commit the sin of asking permission to speak

i am certain that no state will want to be held accountable for shattering a dream
they should also realize that they cannot let things get that far
perhaps we should switch to the new system but with a declaration allowing states perhaps for a transitional period to invoke the old system if they found themselves in the minority
we therefore urgently need to bring forward revisions of that sort
these include enshrining and deepening the economic and social model of neoliberal capitalism extending the militarisation of the european union and institutionally consecrating the union as a political and military bloc and also promoting the federalist institutional approach
the european commission should have greater authority to police these new rules since national governments have shown that they cannot be trusted to do so

it is a modern form of colonialism
that was a very kind gesture from the italian presidency
discussions on the 70 amendments would be very complicated and i very much doubt whether we would arrive at a better solution than that offered by this compromise package
we also have a responsibility for how the rest of the world imitates our practices
despite this we are also considering giving our support to a few amendments underlining the involvement of employees
that being said gmo pollution is not included in the proposal for a directive on environmental liability
with regard to the commissioner 's point on member state responsibility i realize that he had difficulties over the last few months negotiating with the council on this point and that it has not been easy
the polluter pays and so he should
since we already have the requirement to wear a seat belt it makes sense also for the law to require them to be fitted with few exceptions and this is something to be advocated

i am able however to go some way towards agreeing with the commission when it comes to paragraph 9
furthermore the commission intends to hold in early two thousand ninety a public consultation on its future strategy to combat discrimination which may also include the adoption of anti-discrimination legislation outside the spheres of work and employment
this is the case for example where reporters without borders is concerned an organization fighting for freedom of information

such rejection would not be confined to the question of the weighting of votes for spain and poland but would also have shaken the foundations of the project
.
the latter are in the end responsible for the care and treatment given but must guide patients and set out the possible alternatives
.
i think many french people many europeans have identified with the victims because they express part of our way of life
i hope that this time it will be agreed quickly and that the recent accident will speed us towards a solution
as the honorable members know in may last year the commission also presented a proposed framework decision on pollution from ships
mr president with these two packages of measures we are taking a final step in improving and strengthening maritime safety within the european union an area in which i believe we have made considerable progress during this legislature
mr president the proposal for a regulation to transfer cargo and passenger ships between registers comes within the more general anti-labour policy of the european union
i must also thank him for the discussions and contacts with the council
they will also have the effect of informing and reassuring public opinion about the conditions in which nuclear energy is used within the european union
producing a report on safety standards in particular has at times been a real game of cat and mouse with the commission and the council
we all agree that the world will probably be a worse place without a negotiated outcome than with one which is an important political motivation
that is the real scandal of the shipping register
.
i must stress yet again that it is true that european output only amounts to around 2 of the global market
recently 2 000 monkey noses were found in a suitcase at amsterdam airport showing that the illegal trade is thriving
we should mount a strong front to tackle the problem of criminal acts driven by greed
my group and i myself are very concerned that in advance of the polls pre-election disqualifications have occurred which prevent voters from making their own choice
before i make my points to the rapporteur i would ask you to deduct the 38 seconds i have just spoken for
apparently you did not consult that committee you went immediately to the who and you are still quoting what it considers to be desirable levels
i hope i will have some progress to report to you in all those areas when i come back in june for the global assessment of the tampere agenda
the commission is aware that unfortunately this proposal arrives too late to achieve first reading in this parliament
there will be far fewer bubbles in the rivers of europe than europeans have in their baths
we are indeed moving towards the welcome modernisation of the legal framework concerning monitoring the biodegradability of detergents which dates back to the early 1970s

the greens are perhaps the only ones who doubt it
moreover i should like to draw your attention to the gradual regionalisation for which nepad makes provision

nor must the budgetary powers of this parliament be diluted in any way
let the issues that really matter to the people take priority such as the irish government 's support for 100 debt cancellation for the world 's poorest countries
enlargement could make or break the european union
i will end mr president by regretting the fact that mr schulz is not with us
however i think there is more for you to do
he made a strong point about democracy in europe saying that when we draw up constitutions we should put them to the people to secure a popular mandate
i feel that equality between men and women is of the utmost importance and have always condemned sex discrimination
the debate is closed
1
i believe this is laudable because it does not happen very often and i wanted to mention it here
if a joint team of control officials from the relevant countries can establish that tax legislation has been misused and abused a tit-for-tat approach is possible
whilst being against taxation we do not want to prevent the extension of reduced rates of vat for some sectors even though the choice of sectors benefiting from this measure is arbitrary and restrictive
i congratulate mrs echerer on that
everything has failed so far but the sanctions must be intensified
we very much hope that these negotiations will finally lead to a ceasefire agreement and the integration of this group into the transitional government
it will be no easier to reach an agreement in november than in april or may two thousand seventy six in fact i think that it will be much more difficult
it is unacceptable that the commission has not yet implemented its policy of moving irresponsible employees in the area of export refunds when this is an area in which urgent action is required
the commissioners were responsible for what happened within their directorates-general
i was privileged to address the un working group in geneva on indigenous peoples and thus witnessed how it forms a world parliament for some of the most oppressed minorities anywhere in our world
a vote against would also mean having knowledge of the facts and drawing a line under the issue as if it had already finished without clarifying responsibilities
i would add that so far these have not resulted in a satisfactory or sufficient response as regards the requirements of this house
of course we must accept that the institutional framework which the directive in question had for ' opting out ' allowed for it to be abused
we are also told that we need additional flexibility so that people can do overtime to earn a living wage
mr president the cooperation system that links the european union to the acp countries is marked by a dual evolution in opposite directions
mr president commissioner byrne i welcome your statement here this morning but i understand that you went to thailand and were told that it was not avian flu but chicken cholera
how effective are they
i also congratulate the rapporteur on his immense efforts in negotiations with the council to reach an agreement at first reading
however if its work is to be satisfactory and efficient it must be the central reference and coordination point for all the national surveillance centres and reference centres and laboratories of the member states
the member states are currently engaged in implementing as part of their national policies the luxembourg conclusions on reform of the common agricultural policy
this report puts its finger on the painful points of the common agricultural policy and its latest reform and i can only welcome these facts being brought out into the open
a balance therefore has to be struck which links best practice to achievable socio-economic goals
i hope the council takes cognisance of that fact
so then why the urgency
thank you
when it comes to internal policy one has to recognize that for years now europol has been playing a very important coordinating role in detecting the main transit routes
what is the commission 's opinion on that decision and what stance will it adopt with respect to it bearing in mind that it has not taken any decision as regards the viability of the project
we only had a small meeting with the interparliamentary union
how does the commission assess the law on restitution in romania particularly as regards the german minority and could this model also be transferred to other candidate countries
we have three categories of action
with the strengthening of the state our pluralist democracy has made the transition from formal and rhetorical guarantees to effective and genuine ones
i would like to re-state our enthusiasm and commitment to providing protection with particular emphasis on teachers trade unionists and journalists because no democracy can allow them to be murdered
this was applauded by the european union and russia and seen as a clever way for israel unilaterally to withdraw its troops from lebanese land in the year two thousand sixty seven
a viable palestinian state needs the agricultural land and the water sources which are now being closed off
i am accelerating work in three other areas in the corporate governance or company law areas in order to have proposals ready if possible later this year

for example 80 of the flow of foreign trade from my country finland goes by sea and the flexible operation of multimodal transport is absolutely crucial
in this respect the commission proposal still contains a number of shortcomings
if we fail in that the future will be very grim
that can only be provided in the framework of fair competition
as well as having a huge impact on morale in the country this situation also severely restricts the flow of international aid
as i said at the beginning of my speech mrs schreyer will provide details concerning human and financial resources
moreover private investment in education especially higher education is far from adequate in europe when judged against the standards set by our competitors
we have to invest more in research and development and foster more competitiveness and innovation
yes these things exist but there must be a willingness at national level to make them an obligatory component of history syllabuses and of cultural education
journalists are being murdered in russia
by adopting the bigliardo report on public finances in emu the european parliament has finally removed from the original text calls for sanctions against france and germany for not respecting the stability and growth pact
but being a country in transition croatia is facing numerous problems caused by this return
that is perhaps a more important perspective than that of whether there should be one or two more women
i want to continue speaking it is just that i am not feeling well
equal opportunities also mean that women should have opportunities for education but also that they should be able to apply their education in their professional lives
in reality new problems arise all the time
we must therefore persevere in our efforts to build a democratic europe
this gives us grounds for hope
it prevents real aid going to real people on the ground who need access to contraception family planning and other health services
the present compromise explicitly stipulates that previous directives remain fully in force therefore and that is the way it should be why else do we make legislation here
we should therefore clarify whether we are also conferring powers of investigating judges which i hope is not the case or only powers of adjudicating judges
overall the proposed amendments are aimed at improving the situation of the victims
.
there is such a campaign in spain yet more than sixty women have died in previous years and this year is following a similar pattern
monitoring and inspection have played a crucial role in this response
should we leave them to their own devices
everything is being done as if the intervention of this bulimic and power-hungry parliament were a guarantee of wisdom or of legislative moderation
mr president i find it strange that the european parliament should be so busy with these efforts on behalf of enemies of democracy
therefore the liberal motion before us today will not be supported by me as its primary purpose is to bash the united states of american in its global war on terrorism
it is in exceptional circumstances that the unexceptional normal and rational rule of law is most needed
she and i are broadly in agreement on the principles
once the report of this study has been received the commission will evaluate the need for any proposal in this area
that is what we have to reckon with
in addition action is being taken although no valid assessment of the sector has yet been carried out
already altadis is closing sites in france and is setting up in morocco
i shall take the town of talayuela in the extremadura region of western spain as an example

as the number of elderly people grows the requirement for good healthcare and care services grows also
.
there is no obvious need for coordination
for ukraine to develop will take some time
the commission is still awaiting the release of aung san suu kyi a measure which we believe to be an essential condition for making the progress in the reconciliation process genuinely credible
furthermore the type of accounting methodology we need and the necessary reconciliation with third country issuers is dealt here as well
the first had to do with the provision of information about management salaries and bonuses in annual reports
i think that with regard to supervision additional provisions by the council have been included which i also welcome
not only have we been able to ensure the inclusion of such print media in article 17 but we have also succeeded in deleting the clause that imposed exclusive use of the internet
the present proposal is inadequate and that is why the commission has to submit a fresh proposal one containing sufficient protection mechanisms for the european public
.mr president commissioner schreyer ladies and gentlemen here we are at the second reading of a report that should not pose any problems
i do not think that is discriminatory that is the application of mathematics which cannot simply be abrogated by legislation
mr president the eu is the reason for the long journey times for animals

thousands of serbian families have been driven out of a province that is still legally part of serbia mainly by paramilitary forces of the kosovo liberation army uck once classed by the us as a terrorist organization
furthermore in order to harmonise the regulation with the convention and the proposed directive on access to justice members of the public are given a legal standing where an issue directly concerns their interests or rights
i therefore regret that my ultimate proposal to apply article 95 maximum harmonisation has not been adopted and that we have taken article 195 as the basis
the commission can accept the following amendments subject to rewording 2 3 4 5 6 9 10 11 16 18 and 19
the european council also stressed the need for investment in basic research
that was rejected and rightly because not everybody was responsible for the crimes of national socialism
adieu giscard d 'estaing
fifthly the tripartite dialogue between croatia italy and slovenia must continue in the good spirit which surrounds it today so that all the differences and outstanding issues can be settled
in this respect the study states that if the full force of the market is unleashed without any robust frameworks the resultant damage may be extremely serious
if commissioner fischler had been here i would have asked him to comment on how relative stability can live with equal access to waters and resources
with respect to the argument put forward how can we guarantee that the principle of relative stability and article 20 5 of the basic regulation are adhered to
in light of the fact that this is an annex to the framework agreement its periodic renewal does not require a new mandate
these measures concern the protection of data and the exchange of information between law enforcement authorities in the light in particular of the statement adopted by the european council on the fight against terrorism
while this may not necessarily create a clear situation for the airlines it does prevent an accumulation of different obligations
to this day although they fall within the provisions of the treaty of lausanne of nineteen twenty three they have to do without the status of legal personality
that precisely is what we should be discussing among ourselves with great frankness and great honesty
mr president i would simply like to point out that my report is the last report from the committee on fisheries to this house during the present mandate
we are not asking for more rights for deaf-blind people in the european union but for the same rights as other european citizens have
i am extremely pleased that there will in future also be certain rules and systems concepts for recovery facilities so that one person does not think one thing and someone else another as regards recovery facilities
allow me to share with you some thoughts on the challenges we are facing
at the moment it seems that with competition more effective operations really will lead to better efficiency which in most cases also means eco-efficiency in the use of materials
in some countries it is the governments and taxpayers who collect and industry contributes little while in other countries it is precisely the other way round
this is the last legislative part-session of this parliament before the elections
i see that is quite disproportionate to the matter in hand
we have also made substantial progress in developing a workable proposal on the issue of unfair commercial practices where enforcement is the key
some can be accepted partially or with limited changes
this may well be my last speech in the chamber
the extended impact assessment has identified the proposed policy options as the most sustainable from an economic social and environmental viewpoint
secondly we are in the process of drawing up a european inventory of those products that have the greatest potential for improving the environment
such an inventory can help us direct our efforts at the most important products
the adoption of the assimilation of facts and events will be of benefit to frontier workers in particular and the number of derogations and exceptions has been reduced despite our concern about the future development of the annexes
i must say for myself personally how sorry i am that the document we are presenting to you does not go into these matters in sufficient depth
we will also produce the appropriate and relevant reports
we need an efficient cost-effective way of running a transport system
of course we must remember that we still expect the council to submit a common position on the regulation harmonising social provisions in the field of road transport
we can bring the spirit of ' 68 to the debate at 9 p.m.tomorrow
that is not my main point though
this information will be in electronic form and will be exchanged between the authorities of the various member states
the issue does not therefore solely concern access to credit and consumer protection but also economic sustainability with families at severe risk of falling prey to the dictates of monetary policies and to the artificial temptations of consumerism
a more fundamental objection is that deciding on forms of ownership questioning ownership and preventing long-term owner liability for an enterprise are not matters for the eu
there is no intention of arriving at a definitive response during this final plenary
we remember the commitment shown by mr barnier who steadfastly opposed the six countries that want a reduced european budget
mr president ladies and gentlemen allow me to express my sincere thanks for this debate and particularly for the many constructive contributions i have heard here
care will still be taken to ensure that the cohesion target we have set ourselves is actually achieved
finally i wish to comment on the eurostat affair and also on the commission statement even if the commission seems to be leaving
in return may i say that i am also unhappy
the commissioner will reply
he must also provide a declaration highlighting any weaknesses of which he is aware in his particular field of responsibility and outlining the related remedial measures taken or planned
mr prodi on two occasions came to this house in order to set out the action we were taking making commitments to parliament and to the committee on budgetary control and those commitments we have met
commissioner patten you normally address this house in an open style almost ad-lib
for this reason too we object to mrs boogerd-quaak 's report which on the basis solely of ideologically exaggerated demands rejects the agreement thereby making anti-terrorist cooperation impossible by depriving it of any legal basis
many of my colleagues reinforced the attention that i had given to italy myself even further
what is needed here is a complete face-lift to restore some dignity to the resolution

the behavior of the state security court in ankara not only affronted the european union but also the strasbourg court
this means that these recommendations must be at the epicentre of the national action plans submitted by the member states both the current fifteen and the new member states in the autumn of two thousand ninety nine
finally i know that mr bushill-matthews intends to table an oral amendment to amendment 5 to place emphasis upon the need to retain older people in the workforce
we liberals believe that europe can extricate itself from these economic problems but if it is to do so more must be done
i share that concern as growth is taking too long to appear
finally i think that the reference to older workers introduced by mr bushill-matthews complements the reference by mrs hermange to the young unemployed and our position is therefore positive
the european union must continue its support in the regions of the fifteen affected in particular by natural geographic handicaps
those who have today accused mr berlusconi are the very ones who for decades created practiced and imposed what is at the root of what still happens today and what is clearly getting worse in italy

on a date when he alleged i signed in late i actually was present early that morning voting in my committee
the cross stands for love triumphant
insofar as north africa is concerned things are moving ahead
continual enlargement will never be a sustainable answer to the question of how to live with europe 's neighbors
this occurred because the advanced western countries took advantage of their superior competitive position to break into the markets opening up in the eastern countries with an annual increase in their economic potential of about usd 50 billion
nevertheless it is of course an honor for me to appear before the european parliament
i also gave the press a copy this afternoon at a press conference
we have not always been successful and the council has not always matched our pace but the commission has never deviated from its own path for a second
1 150 kilometres of these are in my country poland
let me now recall our enlargement another unquestionable success for the union
the two cornerstones for a common asylum system are now in place
at the same time however ministers have been called to order for failing to observe the rules which they themselves laid down
the netherlands presidency will constantly endeavor not to lose sight of longer-term interests
policies adopted by socialist governments have stunted the growth of economies and drowned us and our vital businesses in costly regulatory frameworks
asked to explain your politics in recent weeks you have described yourself as a reformist of the center
what the voters are telling us telling parliament the council and the commission is that things cannot go on any longer the way they are

your performance in yesterday 's debate was assured
it reinforces our conviction that we can build up a very constructive and cooperative relationship with you

for them that anachronistic colonial war was long over

finally mr president a comment on the issue often mentioned in many speeches from france and germany
mr leinen is absolutely right in saying this and a very important next step is to be taken in connection with the ratification and the referendums which will be held in a number of countries
we are well aware for that matter that ratifying the treaties and in particular by means of referendums is contaminated by internal political issues

there again neighbouring states have the key to change but for their own misguided reasons refused to turn it
indeed it has reinforced the perception across europe that institutions like the commission are too self-serving
how have we helped since november last year
let us acknowledge ladies and gentlemen the fact that the report i am presenting to you is evidence of the considerable unity of the committee i chair a unity that has not always been in evidence
we must build on the added value of cooperation on the actual interests and needs of society

is that deal affected by the council 's decision
these may or may not lead to consumers perceiving prices to be high
we should not forget that some of our member states are still far from possessing really adequate social protection
the recent agreement on a south asia free trade agreement takes explicit inspiration from the eu process
so what can the eu do about it in terms of both carrots and sticks
so it is i am afraid a double-edged sword
the political developments in belarus are of great concern not only to the eu but also to others such as the osce and the us
one extremely important principle was referred to in both the presidency and the commission statements namely the principle of support for society
the government president kuchma with the oligarchs supporting him behind the scenes and the russian president putin who yesterday started a visit to the ukraine lasting several days support their own candidate prime minister yanukovych
it is something that will need to be monitored very carefully
meanwhile the government is trying to find solutions to most of the critical problems
mr president naturally our group too supports this resolution and the demand for a moratorium on using this technique
we have recently been to slovenia and were able to see in a museum the effects of this kind of mine
i hope that this parliament will undertake to broaden the existing convention to include this other type of deadly weapon
thank you very much mr casaca
ukraine will then be obliged to implement fully the single economic space with russia belarus and kazakhstan and possibly even uzbekistan
it cannot be morally sustainable to open negotiations with turkey and with western balkan countries and deny such a right to ukraine

after all asylum seekers and immigrants are entitled to know where they stand in europe
the right of the member states to appoint commissioners themselves is therefore contested when the commissioners concerned are catholics with right-wing leanings but not when they are communists and people with special financial interests

that is not the way i should have liked it to have been
i believe not
mr bourlanges i note your personal statement which will be followed up in the appropriate manner in accordance with our rules of procedure
i would like to thank the ombudsman mr diamandouros for his comments here today particularly in relation to the report
i believe this to be contempt for parliament and i intend to make a formal complaint but i also believe we need to review how we deal with this
now that it has been established the commission considers that it should be pursued with a view to seeking improvements in the internal situation and external relations
good luck
we cannot pretend that we do not see what forces lie behind the falsification of the ukrainian elections
furthermore in the letter signed jointly last december by those six states we are assured of the following which i would like to read in english since it is the original language of the document
our task is to see to it that this house is sufficiently involved and we will of course insist on that through the proper channels and press the point if the need to do so arises
this compromise is beneficial to the european parliament to the council and above all to europe and all of this on time despite tense negotiations
all of us especially the institutions of the european union the european parliament the european commission and above all the member states need to recognize and accept the new worrying increase in the hiv aids problem
i wish to assure you that the entire european commission all my colleagues and i are aware of this issue
when the new system is in place in two thousand ninety six the commission will be far ahead of most public administrations in the european union
last year we specified in the resolution that if it were to transpire that money in a certain sector was still being used inappropriately the commission would have to suspend payment of advances
we have always had a good working relationship and i wanted to say that here
we must have a system that allows people to come forward and say exactly what is going on
not that we are deciding to allow turkey to join the european union
like most of you i have been witnessing for some time now a semantic debate between accession and privileged partnership
in a real democracy they too should be taken entirely seriously
in this context a number of speeches have referred to a link between the economic dimension the social dimension and the environment which is i believe no more than rhetoric and masks a real difference in approach
he is a journalist and a member of our organization and the authorities have never told us what happened to him
.
one should recall that the majority of requests for additional budget allocations by the eu institutions are related to the enlargement of the eu as well as with the new eu financial and staff regulations

since the eu is mauritania 's leading economic partner there is an urgent need to encourage an open dialogue and act as arbitrator between the mauritanian government its civilian and military opponents and human rights organizations
we want to step up protection capacity in regions of origin and we are defining in this report the difference between transit camps and outsourcing our responsibilities to third countries and regional protection
emphatically not
this is something we wish to know and this is something that is enshrined in the constitution
this parliament a moral authority for good behavior has suddenly decided on the most incomprehensible and undemocratic course of action possible and i find this impossible to understand
is that still your position now
this contradiction will of course not escape the public
after all turkish membership threatens to turn the union into a merely economic cooperative which will no longer be able to carry out important supranational responsibilities in a coordinated manner
in so doing it will confirm its credentials as a fully democratic and responsible country and one that respects human rights
on 17 december i trust the european council will formally conclude bulgaria 's negotiations and set the date for signature of the accession treaty in spring two thousand ninety nine
i should also like to address a critical comment to the commission which was right in saying that it needs more money than 1
parliament must take itself seriously
as i see it that alone is a good enough reason for investigating whether this decision is at all sustainable in legal terms
still more it forms part of a campaign to eliminate political opponents by means of slurs intimidation and coercion
our meeting opened curiously with the good news of the dar-es-salam conference and of the commitment made there by all heads of government to end the conflict
let me assure parliament that the commission has been ready to support india in dealing with this tragedy and will do so in the future

the constitution brings to an end twelve years of intermittent reform which have taken us from maastricht to nice via amsterdam and from 12 to 15 and then to 25 member states
some dreams though have not come true in a time such as this in which crime terrorism and the challenges of globalisation are gnawing away at the european social model
otherwise the eu will end up as a regime of the big powers which will damage the eu as a whole
it has also favored terrorist prisoner groups over victim groups who exist as victims because of the horror visited upon them by those terrorists

i will however bear your comments in mind

we see competitiveness as being about creating more jobs in europe by way of growth and better conditions for european businesses
but this does not mean that we cannot proceed now by giving direct priority to the relief for this disaster
i noted with interest the ideas being floated on the possibility of supplying fishing vessels from the commission that is to say european union fleets to the fishing communities in the affected countries
relations between europe and america are founded on shared interests and on the promotion of such shared values as freedom democracy and human rights

mr president after so much consolidation and solidarity in relation to amendments i will ask you to accept one very small oral amendment to the last line of recital a concerning only two words

firstly as you know the first of the planned referendums on the ratification of the european constitution took place yesterday in spain
this shows the commission 's full commitment to modernizing and developing european social systems to tackling social exclusion and poverty and to attaining the target of more and better jobs
for me it is simple
the political line is one dimension and in this regard we are talking about very clear and well-focussed priorities defined when we presented the strategic objectives
this is an objective we cannot abandon and on which furthermore there is consensus until two thousand ninety nine but it must be pursued in a balanced manner
it is the g8 industrialised countries that make decisions often led by their own self-serving agenda
the criminal should always remain a criminal and the victim a victim

does making reference to the average private undertaking not oversimplify the task assigned to the public service
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen a majority of the members of the committee on economic and monetary affairs agreed on a largely balanced report even if mr goebbels is distancing himself from that report today
germany even believes that it is worth making higher net payments to europe in return for the abolition of the stability and growth pact
mr president the rapporteur mr goebbels laments the lack of coordination of economic policies
we show much greater pragmatism
if there is no will to apply budgetary discipline reforms will not help either
too little attention is paid to many other things that have an adverse affect on human health
mr president no because it deals with this paragraph 19 it should come before the other votes
the june list believes however that responsibility should mainly lie at member state level
in our region in the west he told me sadly we have lost these untouched nature sites forever you should preserve yours at any price
it provides jobs and revitalises rural areas
it seeks to ensure them fair treatment by preventing carriers or tour operators from refusing to carry them because of their reduced mobility except for justified safety reasons

issuing licences in the form of a plastic card replacing old licences within 10 years and the facility albeit optional to introduce a microchip facilitate controls and reduce the risk of fraud

it may be that the presence of the union will result not in blackmail but rather in a re-examination of the real usefulness of the commission
we want the people of ukraine to trust the administration again and for them to understand our policies
against this backdrop one might vote against this report for the reasons i have stated
the offences for which he was charged took place 20 years ago and the notion that he still has secrets that could do israel some harm 20 years later is clearly ludicrous
i do not have the requested figures to hand but i am sure that the commission can help us by providing them
it is interesting that since we started work on this we have already added a number of new provisions to this annex
to illustrate this point i should like to list a few alarming statistics which are also included in the report
it would also be a good idea for evaluation reports in future to focus more on evaluating the degree of practical compliance with legislation by the member states
one of my sons worked for an employer who was very health conscious the employer avoided the toxic jobs and gave them to the youngest workers
in this context i should like to raise two matters that are of concern to me
environment is crucial
the funding in question can be secured by removing part of the financial instrument for fisheries guidance from the appropriations allocated to each member state
the tsunami destroyed the coastal and seaside economy
for these and other reasons i am inclined to believe that the sending of around 150 fishing boats is intended to appease european consciences and to be a symbolic gesture
it was because of international pressure that the togolese government started to backtrack
nepal cannot be allowed to regress to a system whereby the king is undisputed ruler and the rights and lives of his subjects are in the hands of one man
an ever-greater number of tibetans are choosing to leave the country because they feel increasingly threatened
for the time being activities continue but new appraisals or identification missions will not be launched for the preparation of the two thousand ninety six cooperation pipeline until further notice
the financial resources for 2007-2013 are manifestly insufficient but budgetary constraints affect the fifteen and the ten new member states differently
where that is concerned i think all the groups in this house are behind you
normally speaking i would have left it to the commission to solve this problem
this visit minister ladies and gentlemen represents an important step in the process of accession and in strengthening the links between bulgaria and the european parliament
then there are proposals that affect the eligibility of specific countries
we cannot therefore see the non-proliferation treaty in isolation from improving regional security structures in the middle east and in south and east asia

.
citizens often complain about delays
the rapporteur was also right to stress the importance of making preparations for the accession of bulgaria and romania which is due to take place in two thousand eighty nine
in this regard i appreciate the good work of the rapporteurs
that is of course a long way from the declared objectives
second we must ensure that a stronger stability and growth pact emerges from the summit with its credibility reinforced
it is therefore extremely important to send a consistent message and to show that we are really working together in the interests of our europe
as for content it is for this house to decide whether or not the final proposal is proportionate
i thank you
i support all the amendments by the socialist group and i also think that others should do so for the sake of the developing countries agriculture and the eu
such a system could even leave the question of ownership of quotas untouched

considerable efforts are currently being made to make short sea shipping a success

i am sure that the desired collaboration will take place in the coming months in order to achieve this result
we are now called upon to go further

this is very worrying the european union cannot ignore this fact
this is an area where the european union needs to step up its action
in the case of syria there is also the issue of support for terrorist groups such as hezbollah
i remain convinced however that this moment will come and it is the responsibility of the union to encourage it

i can only stress at this point that i consider the committee on the environment public health and food safety to have done the right thing in adopting these amendments after all groundwater is mainly a national issue
i believe it to be important that these uniform standards as proposed in various amendments should apply to the most important pollutants right across europe in order to avoid not only distortions of competition but also environmental dumping
i am proposing an oral amendment as a compromise amendment to amendment 8
why is this so
i should like to congratulate mr coveney on this annual report and on the new system that he has introduced
.
obviously we would be frustrated if the measures applied were the same as in luxembourg for example
let me point to those issues to which parliament attached great priority and which were taken on board by the council
i believe that they must be taken into account in order to make progress on the development of audiovisual heritage
now in europe what belongs together can grow together and the ten projects help to bring this about but we also know that the 30 ten projects are a wish-list drawn up in a spirit of national ambition
it is in actual fact the responsibility of the member states first and foremost and of your parliament to decide upon them since the financial perspectives are not only decided upon in the council
the proposal for a directive aims to serve that purpose

the recent election of mr wolfowitz shows that qualifications for the specific task have played a smaller role than political merits
the political dialogue between the union and central asia would facilitate regional integration in the area and would provide a political orientation for the cooperation between the two regions
and after 10 july there will of course be an urgent need for long-term assistance from the international community to implement reform in the political economic and social spheres
indubitably faith in this integration has waned
we must admit that these are areas that although very important are just too dull to excite much emotion
mr president mr president of the commission ladies and gentlemen 60 years have passed since the end of the second world war

my message to minister bo was that to avoid the eu having to take action china needs to give a stronger response to curb its export growth in the short term

i firmly believe that environmental technologies properly resourced and encouraged have great employment and growth potential
similarly within this framework amendments have been tabled which are supported by the group of the european people 's party christian democrats and european democrats for better treatment of the regions which are subject to the statistical effect
diverse organisational forms have also been developed for such cooperation
i also believe very strongly that eu funding should be available to areas in need wherever in the union they happen to be located

it will demonstrate that parliament supports the development of paediatric medicines and that we attach a great deal of importance to the treatment our children receive and to their health

it would in actual fact be totally irresponsible for an asian country which is moreover poor and with a muslim culture to join an unstable union that has an uncertain institutional and economic future
even if priced competitively these commuter lines whether public or private would be profitable
we expect the commission to play a coordinating and supervisory role for short-term measures too
moreover the economic impact of natural disasters this year seems to sound warning bells for our petrol-based society
we hope that all the institutions will engage constructively in a process to secure what is an important directive for all of us
but it will ultimately be through the doha development round that the international community can and must deliver real gains for poor countries by abolishing export subsidies and reducing all barriers to trade including trade-distorting domestic support
i think the example of unicef is a good place to start in understanding the desperate and urgent need to reform the un
unicef justifiably earned the respect of countries and agencies everywhere for its programs of oral rehydration breastfeeding promotion and primary education
we share however the disappointment that he expressed on the failure to pursue a treaty on the international arms trade
much has been achieved in member states through community legislation to meet this environmental challenge
ever mindful of my responsibilities as a representative of the presidency rather than speaking as a partisan figure here today i would respectfully suggest that those inaccuracies are perhaps not so much technological as ideological
there seems to be a presumption inherent in the question which i am not in a position to echo in my response

at the end there is a complicated appendix which seeks to lay down the law on the specifications for codends and even the exact size and shape of codend buoys
that is complete madness and flies in the face of the democratic will of the large majority of our citizens

there are only 877 driftnet fishermen in ireland
mr president poverty is silent
he said that these values are fundamental to our civilisation and are simply not up for negotiation
the program enables everyone to take part in educational programs virtually from the cradle to the grave

the background is that the fluorinated gases were introduced in the nineties to replace the ozone-depleting cfcs and hcfcs
the proposed regulation would then focus on the remaining stationary applications
there is no apparent reason why we should have different legal bases for stationary air-conditioning systems on the one hand and for mobile ones on the other
nor is it the case that there are no alternatives
at the opening of the brussels sitting earlier this month reference was made to the fact that i had recently stated that the scandinavian model of collective agreements was not compatible with the ec treaty
i also wish to emphasise that the european union and the member states have the best and the highest levels of preparedness in the world
there needs to be transparency because it is up to us to make these governments acknowledge their responsibilities
i want to ask the commissioner the same question i asked him last time we debated this issue and that concerns the rest of the world
i did not mention much on the veterinary side because that is to do with the pandemic stage
we have the system and the legislation in place and we will use them

i refer to the proposal for a baltic gas pipeline

back in nineteen eighty nine i wore a badge bearing the chinese words for freedom and democracy
to do that it has to improve its model put in place a system of upwards social harmonisation put a stop to the dismantling of public services and reject a market europe

the international rules in the various conventions are clear on the circumstances of detention and on the obligation to give prisoners a fair trial in front of a competent impartial and independent court
moreover one taxi driver told me that no reason had been given for this

these advances in safety should be accompanied by greater transparency
that is also the firm belief of my group the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe

yet if we in this house think that all of this is just a pipe dream then what message of hope can we give today to the iraqi people
there are signs of widening instability in the region
we need binding targets if not for two thousand ninety eight then at least for two thousand ninety eight
mr president at the end of this month and the beginning of the next the european parliament will once again present its position on climate change at a un conference
let me stress that this can in no way be viewed as an alternative to the united nations process
if we implement all the measures in full this will lead to a 4 reduction compared with nineteen ninety which obviously is not sufficient to meet the target of -8 that we have set for ourselves
the baltic gas pipeline project also represents a huge threat to the environment in the baltic sea region
what is more if this change is taking place it is undoubtedly because of human beings
it means that europe should do less in some areas and should make the lives of our citizens and businesses easier

it would obviously be inconceivable to sever these close links brutally under the pretext of reforming our sugar regime however necessary it may be
that will be crucial to reaching an agreement

to conclude i should like to quote a man of the future alcide de gasperi whom we remembered yesterday
mr president in june the united kingdom blocked the financial perspective proposed by the luxembourg presidency

i stand by the answer i have just given in terms of european law
the progress already made needs to be followed by further implementation further improvements and the allocation of both adequate funding and staffing levels
this will make it a great deal easier for members to vote in favor of a slightly amended version of the common position
participation in such governance fora will see benefits for equal opportunities at various levels

i am sure general morillon will be pleased when i convey to him your commitment to trying to find a resolution to the problem of timing
regarding letter of amendment no 3 the danish liberal party is opposed to aid for the export of live animals but the amendment will not solve this problem

i wish to raise three issues on behalf of myself and my group
if this house does nothing then it is party to every single blow that was rained upon that individual and other men like him and on gay women across the european union
mr president i have to acknowledge that as mr cashman has said even in my own constituency of london we continue to see prejudice and homophobic crime
the june list believes that the eu is a union of values that must operate on the principle that everyone has equal value and equal rights
third-country nationals would acquire the rights of eu citizens while retaining their rights in their home countries
of course you can always count on my staunch support
we should be adamant in having the principle of the single undertaking respected
you have also shown the flexibility required to prevent a freeze on industrial tariffs and services a freeze that would have proved fatal for the negotiations
we did not hear a single word about the need to include social clauses and to respect them there was absolute silence on that topic
the swedish june list will reject this legislative proposal
what has happened between the first proposal in two thousand ninety eight and this second one is not a good example of european politics
we are therefore calling within the framework of close cooperation and a mild adaptation of the new market for certain proposals which are expressed as proposals in the fruteau report
the point raised by the honorable member will form part of our thinking in whatever proposals are put forward by the end of two thousand ninety one

long gone are the days of the taliban regime with its horrific abuses and its breaches of the most basic rules and principles of human rights
lastly i should like to point out that phobias as the manifestation of behavioural problems cannot be combated in legislation nor at parliamentary level
we presume however that agreements entered into will be observed by all the parties
we have thus chosen to vote against the report as a whole but are well disposed towards individual paragraphs mainly those dealing with genuinely cross-border environmental problems
this policy debate can and should be radical but it must take place within the constitutional context and be closely related to issues of competences to instruments and to procedures
what we in this house expect of course is a road map or sketch of how things are to progress
why
five more are in preparation with armenia azerbaijan egypt georgia and lebanon
the neighborhood policy should help them to find an answer to their frozen conflicts
mr president neighborhood policy can take two forms and they are both very different
clearly neighborhood does not automatically entail membership but it can result in membership
with globalisation and interdependence it is clear that no wall can isolate the european union from its closest neighbor countries hence the importance of an active and generous neighborhood policy

a great merit of the report and of the cooperation created between the commission and parliament is that they give a reassuring answer to the anxieties

.
however this principle is not laid down in the treaties even though it has been used following court of justice case-law to promote the free movement of goods

that is what the nations of europe want
did the employment rate increase or decrease
today i am delighted that with the amendments we have made sweeping changes to the bolkestein directive
however in a diversified context like europe with new countries seeking opportunities and old countries trying to protect themselves with small and large enterprises and 25 different legal systems compromise is the only way to proceed
they are defined and enforced by the law and legal systems of the member states of the european union
worst of all they have inflamed hatred and fear and they have gained an audience for their views
conversely if things evolve in the right direction more could be done through community actions
only syria cuba and venezuela rejected the proposal
overcoming these obstacles is without doubt a major achievement and one on which bosnia and herzegovina are very much to be congratulated
that is why we put forward several proposals in the salzburg communication concerning economic development trade and investment
mr president there are surely not very many people who believe that the presidential elections in belarus on 19 march will live up to even the most elementary democratic ground rules
the students of this university doubtless give real hope for the revival of belarus
.
the infrastructure linked to forestry needs modernisation
they are not for sale
we know that there is a spectacular increase in the demand for sexual services during major events like this and of course in the incidence of criminal activities such as people-trafficking and forced prostitution
without underestimating the sensitivity of the issue i should like to remind you that the right of establishment anywhere in the community is a fundamental freedom and cornerstone of the single market
whether member states should be in solidarity or competition with each other is no longer the issue
in short people and companies look for the best place in which to realize their ideas services and products and there is was and will be nothing wrong with that
unemployment in the eu currently stands at over 8 but even so there is a shortage of workers in certain areas
we live in a community
where there are problems they do not need the same thing to be repeated twenty times but rather they need something serious and decisive to be done once and for all
now that we are creating a new globalisation fund let us not forget the old instruments the social fund and skills updating together with responsibility taken at national and regional levels
the commission is fully prepared to discuss the terms applying to the fund and i have noted a number of ideas that i regard as important in this respect
indeed its reluctance to allow the director of the institute to be answerable solely to the management board and not to the commission is very revealing in that regard
in all these places europeans were as god-fearing as they were industrious
granted their group was hardly representative and they appear idealistic in what they call for but their idealism is impressive

it is imperative that all the inhabitants of the european union have equal opportunities when it comes to accessing these technologies and this at a cost that corresponds to standard market prices
commissioner in view of the expectations of the industry in question and the sensitivity of european public opinion i would like to know what actions the commission will take to ensure that that country respects wto rules
i believe however that the measures put forward are still totally inadequate given the severity of the issue
the commission is prepared to be at the forefront of this battle
there have been rumors of more kidnappings but they have not been confirmed
we would find that very regrettable because it benefits nobody
european industry is gearing up for the challenges of competing in a global economy
we need the production and distribution of energy generation and the network to be separated
.
i voted for paragraph 9 part 2 on the endowment of the globalisation and adjustment fund by businesses as this is a voluntary donation
in the final vote we have chosen to vote in favor of the guidelines for the two thousand ninety three budget procedure in spite of our having serious objections where two points are concerned
almost a year has passed since the relaunch of the lisbon strategy agreed by the spring european council last march
we can now of course simply combine the two but some members will be cross at not being able to speak to the brok report because they were not there
we must waste no time in laying hold of the necessary instruments for which of course the constitutional treaty makes provision and use them to restore our capacity to welcome new members
following on from the debate that we held this morning it should be pointed out once more that 99 of enterprises are small and medium-sized enterprises which between them account for 80 of employment
mr radwan made a similar appeal to the council
i fail to see how any of the actions yesterday in any way contributed to those objectives
they are very much at the forefront of our concerns
the future scenario concerns us
it was difficult to reach an agreement in a few months to establish the body that would replace the discredited commission on human rights
the year two thousand forty eight is set to be a good one for multilateralism
apart from that however there are no policy initiatives as the primary purpose of the proposal is to conform to the wto panel findings within the deadline
here however we are talking about and focusing on quality in particular
anyone who has worked with her knows that this is not always an easy task
in the country i know best research in two thousand ninety nine found that the introduction of competition in conveyancing resulted in fees falling

on 30 june two thousand ninety nine the conference of presidents decided however to split this program once again
today parliament has given its opinion on the strategy for managing future enlargements of the european union

we are pleased to see that negotiations between moldovan and transnistrian officials on the issue of these latin-script schools restarted in february after a hiatus of seven months
one lingering core concern is political freedom

it will be discussed by the conference of presidents
europe needs them to construct a coalition of the coherent
that meeting of energy ministers came up with very useful and helpful suggestions which will be discussed tomorrow and the day after

the member states themselves choose their energy mix and that is all to the good
we cannot however afford to have such a situation in europe any longer
legislation must be laid down so that part of the funding allocated to agricultural policy is available for biomass growth production and energy needs
it is no longer a technical matter confined to technocrats and has become as much a part of the cfsp as the remit of energy ministers

mr president i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very comprehensive report on this issue of major importance throughout the eu-25 namely the challenge of demographic change and the importance of solidarity between the generations
the production of biomass and bio fuels in particular will not only improve the state of the environment and increase employment in rural areas but will also preserve human dignity by increasing the income of whole families

success in this endeavor is crucial for you and for the union as a whole but it calls for greater courage and determination on the part of the commission
it was a compromise
mr harbor is being a little pessimistic about the reception given to this revised proposal
i would like to say something very briefly about one or two of the issues that have been touched on in this debate
if there is a hard landing in the construction industry it has implications for revenue it has implications for unemployment payments and therefore revenue it has implications for consumer confidence
in a word this program has worked on the assumption that what we needed was not an elitist program but a program that would be appropriate for all europeans
i would also like to add however that under no circumstances can we exclude other victims who are equally innocent and unfairly treated by history such as the victims of fascism and other european dictatorships
a prize will be awarded to the european capitals of culture that meet the criteria and objectives of that initiative
others would cite a much higher figure
the council will be here tomorrow
mr president i can give the assurance that we believe that sustainability is not only a treaty principle but also the most important principle individually and socially in building economic progress with social and environmental responsibility
i am particularly pleased that we will have increased funding for programs directly related to the new lisbon agenda namely research lifelong learning trans-european networks competitiveness and innovation
there is no point in us harbouring lofty ambitions if we reject the financial resources needed to fulfil them
you can add to that eur 5 billion for the lisbon strategy half from the european budget and half from the european investment bank cash
these matters should be dealt with at the earliest opportunity
promising the creation of 10 million jobs was after all strongly reminiscent of the first lisbon summit
french energy companies are carrying out foreign take-overs but the borders remain closed for foreign take-overs in france and now that the services directive is on hold foreign workers are also barred
indeed countries preparing themselves painfully for membership viewed the prospect of a change to the rules of the treaty as one might a change to the rules of a race just when the finishing line is in sight
we regret however that the adopted report will serve to contaminate european history and that the majority in parliament has opted to contaminate the collective memory on which the identity of current and future generations will be based
that is not possible at the moment because only countries that are willing and able to respect the human rights laid down in the european convention on human rights can join the council of europe

the report provides a very clear steer on the areas where change can be most beneficial simplification of the notification procedure measures to facilitate cross-border fund mergers and pooling
this is investment rather than a cost
in particular we will pursue further signatures to the ecall memorandum of understanding and we will follow the progress in implementing the appropriate emergency services infrastructure for 112
mr president i will not hide from you the fact that i have some anxieties about the future of our european schools
i therefore could not support it
there is a central issue that is a problem for you and also a problem for us cocaine and drug-trafficking
i have looked closely at the history of coca in europe
that is the terrible story of my constituent mirza tahir hussain condemned to death early next month
we have supported clear labeling consumer involvement banning health or nutritional claims on alcoholic drinks as others have mentioned and many of the other items on which we will be voting tomorrow
i believe that this is a good test of whether we actually do so
eel stocks have now declined dramatically
western sahara is occupied yet no one acknowledges the hegemony exercised by morocco
we are all aware that for many years now the moroccan government has done everything in its power to stop a referendum from being held on the independence of western sahara
that too is a citizens ' agenda and it is precisely what many of the citizens expect from us
the sea is a force and capital that has not yet been developed in our policy and we must work in this direction
it has continued with its assassinations arrests and military incursions into our towns villages and refugee camps
the new agreement provides for a significant reduction in the number of fishing licenses awarded to the member states
if we do not do this we shall be swimming against the tide against the lisbon strategy against growth and jobs and against the internal market
you share responsibility for this
he is willing them to win and it is absolutely clear that they are going to do so
in relation to other matters i note that the 16 areas marked as of serious concern in october have now been reduced to 6
the chairman of the bulgarian national assembly george pirinski said earlier this week that the european union should use the same scale of measurement as it did with the ten countries that joined in the last enlargement
here we are talking about article 95
for example i wish there were more of them in brussels
technical requirements are set out in detailed technical standards
farmers could obtain four times more by way of total net income if the various arrangements were circumvented and the money sent to farmers directly
humanity is therefore the principle of european enlightenment which is nowadays proving to be the major demand of european societies and the major risk for the leaders of europe
enlargement was certainly a very important development in the union from the point of view of foreign relations too
the first has to do with the human rights guidelines which the report quite rightly emphasises and which is of great significance in terms of the more effective implementation of eu policy
mr president firstly i welcome the change in the scheduling of debates to allow the human rights report to be debated this afternoon in the primetime slot
i am equally pleased that disabled people have been included generally with a particular emphasis on the united nations convention on the rights of people with disabilities
poverty matters to them it matters to us
indeed some european union aid was being used to buy electricity and fuel oil for immediate consumption
an energy community could bring down prices because of the new investments it will bring in
our fellow citizens need a european union that is very clear in terms of the measures it takes
there are some areas of this report that we are unable to support such as the cfsp text and the references to the new freedom security and justice agenda
in order to achieve all that we shall obviously need to draw up a new constitution that is shorter simpler clearer and refocused on the great principles on which our union is founded
.
i therefore see paragraphs 8 9 and 21 of the report by mr brok that we are considering as being a welcome helping hand for they each promote a transatlantic approach to the relationship with china
my thanks also go to the commission whose officials dealing with these matters have always been supportive and professional so thank you everyone
the only reason that this has not been more widely condemned is precisely because it affects romani women
whatever measures may be taken in relation to these detainees they must comply fully with the principle of human rights and the rule of law
ladies and gentlemen how can we talk of europe its enlargement and solidarity
in two thousand forty six he committed the serious crime of wilful fire-raising
these are questions that must be asked after the world cup
this time the sporting event is being held here in the european union
so i do not see that we have a problem there
we are fortunate in my country to have fresh water resources and must ensure that future generations have access to the same quality and supply of that water
why do the commission and the council not wish to have in place such groundwater protection requirements which will safeguard the maintenance of groundwater in the most natural state possible
there are still many member states including ireland which are struggling to implement it
what i heard seemed to be open to interpretation and a few explanatory words would be welcome
that is a different tune
the health program is also important
this is just one example
with the commission and the council having followed the same line as our assembly last september and december we had a right to hope that tunisia would respect its european commitments
.
in that context let me welcome the recent meeting between prime ministers kalvitis and fradkov and hope that this represents the start of an intensified bilateral dialogue
the agreement will affect only a small percentage of travellers
one example of successful cooperation is the conclusion of the readmission agreement
when consultations were opened under article 96 of the cotonou agreement mauritania gave undertakings in the areas of respect for democratic principles fundamental rights and freedoms the rule of law and good governance
we have put forward a proposal for a directive laying down criminal sanctions in the fight against counterfeiting
i think and i will say it again that this area is so important and so rapidly developing that it requires a specific conceptual and systematic approach
this commission proposal covers a number of aspects
therefore i should like to make a proposal to the commissioner
that is a good thing and it has been hard work but we can see that all parties are now back round the table and deliberating together how to proceed
when the french and dutch voted against the constitution last year we ignored their verdict
your colleagues can tell you about it but i would ask you to make a final effort and i wish you the best of luck
a great deal of lucidity and courage will be required
well done
a great deal of pomp and flashing lights a great deal of silver and porcelain distinguished guests one important engagement after another and now even a meeting with george w.bush
and while this practice is in use the chances of achieving our goals concerning sustainable development are very slim
i would say to mr roszkowski that his mention of paedophiles in the context of sexual orientation is deeply misplaced and disgraceful
by extension there should of course also be clarity about the distribution of the security costs in the entire transport sector
where sky marshals are concerned i take a very firm line
our current proposal on portfolio trades is that the block regime will apply with respect to each constituent share
it is outrageous that common rules in the field of civil aviation security do not automatically apply to gibraltar because of the ongoing refusal by spain to recognize gibraltar as a full part of the european union
finally what would happen during wto negotiations if instead of trying to raise standards relating to oenological practices we lowered them
i should be grateful to the commission if it would kindly shed some light on these points not least in view of the next wto reform of the wine sector
furthermore the basic regulation for this com allows member states in relation to wine-making practices and treatments to impose stricter national conditions in order to ensure that the characteristics of their quality wines are maintained
the eu has from the outset been determined to assist the government and people of east timor
that will not do
can it be because you know you would suffer a humiliating defeat
whilst the issue of absorption capacity may be mentioned in the chapter on enlargement it is not really flagged as a condition for future enlargements
the president of the and the president of the galician parliament have both sent messages calling for a decision in favor
it is important to thrash out the rights of the host country and the obligations of the home country
.
allow me to reiterate the matters that concern us they are the transitional period for proper adaptation to the new circumstances and clear guidelines
i would question whether the eur 150 threshold for donations to charity organizations is not rather low after all
that is why i support a full impact assessment being carried out before any proposals are brought forward
however i am pleased that in this house at least we are going in the right direction even if some countries like my own are dragging their heels
.
most of all it requires a definition of its current goals
if britain should decide to withdraw from the eu and thus cancel its contribution do you have a plan b
firstly when it comes to innovation small is beautiful
europe 's aspiration must be to remain a great industrial power and it must not be content simply with developing the services sector whose future is often intimately linked to the existence of a solid industrial base
the choice for english football and sports fans has also improved
thank you commissioner for that information
as it has been written into the articles the provision is legally binding
as many of you have often said the union must be able to demonstrate the benefits it offers to its citizens in other ways too and more tangibly
i am convinced that the treaty negotiated with the member states is essential for an expanding union
transparency subsidiarity better regulation should not be seen as sometimes they are seen as just technical matters they are political matters
the drive to make europe more competitive does not begin and end with summit conclusions
i know that i will not get away with rhetoric with hardly any of you and i am not even going to try
that is why we think it is important to follow these two paths at the same time
i am sorry that the representative of the council has repeated that language and that lack of balance in her introduction this morning
stop this scandal and ensure that international law is adhered to
does the commissioner have any ideas on this particular situation
without a doubt should it be our priority to ensure that our people are protected against the dangerous affects of nuclear waste
however i decided to abstain from the vote because the proposed council directive does not take into account the dangerous effects of shipments and reprocessing of radioactive waste on nuclear-free member states like ireland
soon we will remember the victims of the london bombings
- the oral question by ewa klamt on behalf of the ppe-de group to the commission on european union immigration policy o-0064 two thousand ninety nine b6-0313 two thousand ninety nine
from this point of view i am delighted that the commission is putting forward proposals aimed at dealing with these challenges
problems such as the brain drain the high cost of transfers of money and the weakness of the financial infrastructure on the ground are of very particular significance in sub-saharan africa
the right to development is multi-faceted however and it means economic exchange cultural exchange conflict management combating terrorism environmental protection and policies to promote gender equality
the rights of all workers must be protected whether they be legal or not
furthermore all workers who might come into contact with needles and other medical sharps are to be offered vaccination against hepatitis b.
the meps from the czech ods cannot support such a position with their votes
that might help considerably
we must do what we can to make the internet safer
it is a neighbor of the european union and a typical enemy of online freedom
i note that we are beginning the parliamentary year with a disagreement between the two largest groups and that is just as it should be
in general details of the safety of nuclear power stations and of the requirements imposed on them by the authorities are not available to the public
firstly member states must be given the maximum freedom possible when they come to setting and applying the operating charge
to conclude ladies and gentlemen i should like to say that raising car prices does not reduce the number of cars in circulation
the right way forward is therefore for us to adopt a community perspective to address the risks of maritime pollution
you made reference to a belgian business that has developed in the copper sector
these costs arise
human dignity must come first
.
these are the most significant conclusions that i think we should draw from this very important debate
i hope that on all sides of the house people would agree on the importance of those phrases and agree that they should not just be empty phrases but concepts of real meaning
it has been discussed in the college of commissioners and in the council as have other areas such as the use of wind and solar energy
our argument therefore is that without a strong efficient industrial basis it will not be possible to carry out the expansion of the services sector that would be necessary to solve the employment problem by this means alone
together with my fellow members i hope that the commission will take this approach further and that it will return to us with proposals based on those for which we shall vote tomorrow
the status process for kosovo is led by un special envoy martti ahtisaari
they want the international community to basically strip kosovo bare so as to then be able to make this out to be an act against the serbian people
i have no doubt that this will also determine whether albania is mature enough for eu membership which in any case is still far off
it is true that more resolute and determined reform efforts must be undertaken by albania as well as efforts to build up properly functioning institutions and a democratic culture
.
once again the european commission is taking them for a ride if i may say so
the commission has also responded to the environmental disaster and has supported the lebanese government through the community civil protection mechanism in order to tackle the huge environmental damage
if such a state is to exist and be independent it follows that withdrawal from the occupied territories will be necessary
we support the ongoing development of multifunctional efforts to promote peace
lifting the blockade of lebanon is now a matter of urgency but the main priority is to settle the conflict between israel and palestine before it is too late
europe must raise its voice
we must imbue the middle east conflict with the sprit of the euro-mediterranean process with cooperation with solidarity with dialogue between cultures and peoples in order to establish and maintain peace
when we saw the various international observers at the palestinian elections having their authorisation removed diplomatic and parliamentary immunity repeatedly violated and legitimately elected members of parliament and ministers detained should we not have taken action
the usa actively pursues a policy of interference and shows scant regard for sovereignty and international law and its ultimate goal is the geostrategic control of the region and control over the region 's ample energy resources
furthermore as i mentioned it has become clear that there is still a need for closer cooperation between terrorism and air security experts
however we also agree that these relations are fundamentally different
the eu must take a decisive stance on this
the two must go hand-in-hand
one rare example of common interest is in the fight against international islamist terrorism as china has problems with its own uighur muslim minorities
four issues are of particular importance in this case
this is work that cries out for more parliamentary involvement and i know that this is something the hague conference would also welcome
in other words they are blackmailing us
it is important for parliament to participate in this process
we must be resolute in the fight against the fires in the fight against the destruction of property and our forests and in preserving the future
it means especially that we cannot continue to allow agriculture accountable for only 2 of our economy to remain the stumbling block of these talks
the fate that awaits them there is so cruel that it defies the imagination
i hope that this time we will go beyond mere words and i agree with what mr rueda our spanish colleague said recently about not applying double standards
three hundred and one members voted in favor of the resolution yet we are unaware of any facts that would substantiate the claims it makes
the members concerned have never listened to nonetheless they voted in favor of a document bearing no relation to truth or reality
that many respiratory diseases and the consequences resulting from them are attributable to high levels of air pollution particularly in densely-populated areas and conurbations in the eu is not disputed
in the thematic strategy the level of ambition opted for lies between a b and c and the maximum technically feasible reduction scenario
it set relatively ambitious aims and that applies to air quality too
since the entry into effect of the air quality directive in two thousand ninety nine which specifies ceilings for pm10 dust particles ten member states have failed to meet the requirements
without source measures that were often announced years ago by the commission stricter or less strict values for pm10 or pm2.5 serve no purpose whatsoever and i am not even talking about nitrogen
that to me is completely anti-european
luckily we in the czech republic have very recent direct experience of this degrading patronising behavior and of having to face a constant stream of pointless new conditions and quotas as well as one-sided restrictions
the second train carries european efforts to develop a strong common foreign security and defense policy a task towards which turkey will make an extraordinary contribution
we look forward to eventual turkish membership of the eu
perhaps however we will have the answer to this later on
turkey aspires to join europe
on the whole we parliament can count the negotiation results as a great success not only for parliament but also for the public
it is hoped that it will take place in november in tripoli libya
despite the borders the terrible risks and the ever-increasing tolerance of violations of international law we will not succeed in stopping immigration and that has to be a point on which we are all quite clear
no more idle talk minister
the debate is closed
the case law of the european court of justice has done little to clear the fog
.
within this framework attention will need to be paid among other things to the high import duties and extensive technical barriers maintained by india
this is an important subject which should be raised at the forthcoming summit in october
although it in the past set milestones for equality of opportunity in europe there is a yawning gulf when it comes to realizing this principle in global trade policy
support measures need to be taken
.
the nub of this debate is that by ensuring that rates of use reflect reality and scientific reports we will be able to plug all gaps
if we are going to ask consumers to choose organic we are going to have to ensure that what they buy is actually organic
the results of work carried out by liberec technical university and a company in the town were in terms of the research and application of nanotechnology absolutely world-class including the manufacture of exceptionally high-quality machinery
there is also the joint research center which could do more to deal with what has become known as the anxiety industry and its objectivity would certainly be a sound basis on which to monitor these new technologies
you will have the opportunity to express your views on this during the one-minute questions
hold your head high for the rest of the presidential term
one a green light for the eit two some patent legislation or at least a promise to have it and three a common energy policy
the earth is still round and will the eu not be harmed after destroying its own manufacturing capabilities
for this reason i have also drafted two amendments that i will proceed to present
in this way in some countries and in some sectors a closed caste has been created often inaccessible on the basis of merit but increasingly and all too often based solely on the hereditary line
do we really believe that it is not worth having 50 people working to maintain a high level of vigilance in connection with human rights in europe
i voted this way because the fighting bull must not be allowed to die out and its existence is safeguarded by the institution of the bullfight
now that is clearly a fraud on the french taxpayer as well as a fraud on the european citizens
strictly speaking it is the credibility of the eu that is at stake here
she introduced it with her usual efficiency
i therefore request you to look upon save ii as a complementary action which is thus not intended as a substitute for actions taken by the member states themselves
will there be really any interest among the member states to take these measures
secondly we must not forget that the market for generics is a purely commercial one and involves only products which are commercially successful
we know that this work is done for european companies in turkey and in iceland for example
in our group i speak for something that we call the minority but i in fact believe that in this case the minority is bigger than the majority
i assure members of my group that everything was conducted properly
we insisted that a register should be compiled - properly compiled in every member state
now a new register is to be set up because the first procedure posed too many problems
recent visitors to brussels were taken aback by the continuing construction of the european parliament 's new headquarters there which has been going on since nineteen ninety and the ornate nature of the building in question
could we not bring officials from the agriculture ministries in the countries of the former eastern bloc over to brussels and send dg vi people to those countries to explain its policy
i do not know that the case has yet been well established that the scale of alleged distortion is in some way a significant problem or impediment to the functioning of the internal market
subject extension of the common foreign and security policy to common defense
thank you commissioner
mr president ladies and gentlemen the two aims being pursued are indeed the restoration and strengthening of confidence in the safety of the transfusion chain and the achievement of self-sufficiency in blood
mr president the european parliament did not wait until the maastricht treaty was adopted to place constant emphasis on all public health issues
a meeting of experts to discuss issues related to public awareness of blood and blood products is scheduled for next week in rome under the italian presidency
this consideration has led us to plan a tight schedule of meetings over the next few weeks
how are these countries to develop the ecological and social aspects of their economies if the so-called conditions of accession are based on an export-orientated development process
they aspire to our standard of living of course but they are driven even more strongly by the twin desires for security and to carry more weight in world affairs
the idea is simple to enable european citizens traveling around europe to have on their person at all times the information on their state of health allowing them to be treated properly wherever they are
if a form of health card is to be devised then it should extend far further than the eu 's borders and we would like to see something established at the wto level for example
welcome
ladies and gentlemen our common position must be that such an accident must never happen again
such a meeting which is to deal exclusively with co-operation in these areas would have been quite unthinkable 10 years ago
mr president i agree with the feeling in this house that does not wish to polemicise
in that case it must resolve to put the community 's house in order
i am sure you cannot read all the many press reports even those in germany
i would like to ask the commissioner if he will implement an effective promotional campaign in relation to beef and also a factual credible information campaign for consumers
however tricky a tax of this kind might be its introduction depends primarily on whether or not the necessary political will is there
i shall be very brief
clearly we can no longer look to the government for assistance here
however the exclusion of roosevelt johnson 's ulimo from important government posts and failure to comply with the agreement 's stipulations on disarmament and demobilization lit a new slow-burn fuse
the motion for a resolution which we are introducing today refers to nine more murders which we fear will go unpunished - in the same way as the 94 other murders committed in recent years
a person such as alexandr nikitin should in such circumstances be regarded as a great champion of peace who should receive the full support of the european union
secondly structural reform of the energy sector is important so that nuclear power station operators can be assured of an income they can spend on safety
the same goes for the continuance of the muslim-croat federation in bosnia
however even a microscope will hardly reveal the social element of projects funded from the cohesion fund
those are two specific questions
the council finally concluded that the measures already decided upon along with the selective slaughter program that was still to be adopted constituted adequate conditions for instituting a gradual lifting of the export ban
i do not need to repeat my explanation
it could be paid for for example by a tax on co2 which will increase the costs of energy something that is paid for by private individuals
lower taxes create more problems than they solve
my second point concerns the actual question of amendment no 2
the van putten and verhagen reports by the committee on development and cooperation add details to these principles
certainly not
i am also grateful for the fact that the discussion looked at the main problems and that the time we have spent on this discussion has done quite a lot to clear up some misunderstandings
we must stop creating hierarchies as will happen with union citizenship if its excludes 10 to 14 million people from exercising their rights
it would be a victory for the anti-democrats and a defeat for faith in the power of argument
the date of 9 may is not just a holiday for brussels and the european institutions
in saying that such and such a cultural object must not be taken out of the country are we saying that cultural goods ought really to be available for broadly based public and social enjoyment
the debate is closed
those ladies and gentlemen are our areas of action for the months immediately ahead
we must indeed place a very special emphasis on education and continuing vocational training or the lifelong learning process
by supporting this kind of development then we shall at the same time be helping to combat illegal immigration
in conclusion mr president ladies and gentlemen what we needed here was not a general free-trade agreement but an agreement on cooperation close cooperation
that is why the commission parliament and the council must make it clear how the money will be found and how the famous partnership claimed as the definitive answer is going to be constructed
finally i welcome the fact that mr van miert is the commissioner here this evening
that is naturally a serious message from parliament but i should like to ask you and urge you to preserve some sense of reality we cannot go on piling up reports and programs
this is because austria has concluded bilateral agreements with germany and the netherlands
cooperation in research and technological development
this attempt had never been made before
it will be possible to carry out experiments and to develop european standards which we are so looking forward to
plutonium is dangerous and this is an issue which affects me as a young person a great deal because i know that something could happen involving it
we retract our signature
if i say that it is too soon for the ban on these three products to be lifted i am not denying that there may be conditions under which a very high level of safety can be guaranteed
the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 13 june nineteen ninety six pursuant to rule 95 of the rules of procedure has been distributed
for wednesday 3 july nineteen ninety six i have a request from the group of the party of european socialists for the report by mr pelttari on the bioethics convention to be postponed
this is also the case in the area around the baltic sea as mr sindal points out in his excellent report
the commission 's green paper on innovation makes a very useful contribution to the debate on competitiveness and deserves to be looked at closely in terms of how it can be applied at both national and community level
this is a crucial time at which to be holding this debate and it calls for more balanced guidelines than those before us at the moment
mr president you have anticipated the point of order i wished to make
mr president ladies and gentlemen we are debating the crisis in the community 's fishing industry
but where the measures affect competition and have a cross-border impact then we naturally have to impose certain limits
therefore i cannot be more specific
with this report we are at something of a crossroads
after all it would be ironic if such proposals were by default to jeopardize the future of two- and three-wheel vehicles
what course of action is open to us as things stand now
possibly we need to look at something like a rechar or resider program for agriculture but action is needed very very quickly
on that basis we came up with the figure of ecu 650 million which is being discussed today
we need different macroeconomic policies which generate employment
that task is to transform an economic community an area without internal borders into a union of nations a political union like it says in the maastricht treaty
mr president-in-office mr president of the commission it is already three months since work on the igc opened officially in turin and we are forced to recognize that we find ourselves in a blocked situation
the europe we wanted and still want is one with a multiplicity of cooperation agreements between states of course but even more between industrial commercial and agricultural enterprises
ifor is playing an important role in mineclearance and the committee on foreign affairs is minded to promote budget lines to assist the process
what does the word conciliation mean in italian mr president-in-office
i have not seen any such thing
mr president in today 's oral questions the passport freedom which exists in scandinavia is referred to as the nordic passport union but that is not its proper name
but it is a reality at the moment that britain and one or two others certainly do not see that happening in the immediate future
there is no need in this respect to eliminate the role of member states in this type of cooperation policy
the commission cannot accept amendment no 10
lastly - and this was something that was mentioned both by you mr mather and by mr papakyriazis - i am pleased to inform you that there are five amendments which are totally acceptable to the commission
we can support amendments nos 1 2 4 and 5
but the discussion will be brought into discredit if it is used for internal policy purposes and distorted into a kind of story time or unworldly energy policy
and that is why 55 nuclear plants are currently under construction
only yesterday an informal meeting of the permanent council of the osce was held in vienna with an albanian delegation to discuss the osce 's own report
his file was wrongly closed
nothing else is going to work
i took up these concerns and reported them to the president and the parliament staff organized for us an ordered debate in which the various subjects referring to human rights were kept separate
the difficult negotiations are also constantly being undermined by what is going on on the ground
at any event the chinese president will not be able to come here
now just to get back to the comprehensive test ban treaty currently being negotiated in geneva there must not be any loopholes to allow countries to conduct nuclear tests
this should be done not only in relation to organized crime but also in relation to individuals who commit such offences
but we can make this increasingly difficult and expensive for them and thereby thwart their tactics and strategy to some extent at least
i warmly thank the rapporteur again for accepting the amendments from the committee on budgets
it is not just an economic burden which we seek to ease by technology
the report by mrs mouskouri the rapporteur on which i too want to congratulate her warmly endorses our analysis of the impact of the information society on the european languages and vice versa
mr president after this excellent report by mr konecny i can be very brief
this parliament 's group of the party of european socialists will fully support this report
but there were other points too points which i had identified as priorities in my pre-florence address to this house where progress has been made
no resources no greater coordination no adjustment of the broad economic guidelines and the policy mix within it which we had urged on the council just a few weeks ago
they blame the european union and my group does not want to be associated with this failure on employment
we are on the eve of a new treaty on the eve of the enlargement on the eve of the restructuring of the welfare system in every country of the union
how is it possible to speak positively of florence in the face of virtually unanimous criticism from observers
if we look at the current situation then it is disappointing nowhere near 15 more like 5
well now we are and the commission 's report is a response to this fast-changing situation
in essence it is a means of providing yet more help to large companies
mr president late payment is the scourge of businesses the length and breadth of the single market
this was dealt with in mr harrison 's second report
the second question is about the way small and medium-sized enterprises are being strangled by delays in payment by larger firms and also by public authorities
the commission will include the european parliament 's proposal in its preparation of the mechanism for the elis initiative an initiative which also supports the creation of jobs by small companies via a loan guarantee system
i occupy room 238 in ipe 2 from which i normally have the pleasure of observing the french countryside
the common position before us today is generally one which parliament would agree with
it has a duty to increase the safety of citizens facing dangers posed by the concentration of hazardous substances in the atmosphere particularly in urban areas
it will replace directive 82 501 also known as the seveso directive
and i am sure that all of us can look forward to this proposal increasing the protection we provide for both people and the environment against the dangers of major accidents which could have disastrous consequences
we hope that these rules will continue to apply in the future
this measure is basically intended to rectify a situation which has been worsening progressively of late
the next step will be a schengen protocol in the treaty and the abolition of article 7a after the forthcoming igc
it was not addressed to either the commissioner with responsibility for consumer protection or - with all the more reason - to the commission as a whole
we must learn from experience deregulation and the pursuit of competitiveness by the intensification of farming have created this problem
i see from the list that at least ten speakers have only one minute and i must tell the political groups yet again that i consider one minute 's speaking time to be unacceptable
the financial perspective is inadequate it lacks balance in terms of the priority given to the objectives that we are setting
secondly the priorities to be given to the projects must be borne in mind within a perspective of political dynamics and we should also apply the philosophy proposed in the report which we are now analyzing
great caution is necessary in dealing with genetic material
when those conditions have been fulfilled the moment will come to consider re-ordering the program whether in iraq or elsewhere
i take issue with my colleague there from england who seems quite complacent about this and i do trust that the commission does not share this complacency that frankly it does not matter very much
certainly once we decide that embryos are human beings we shall have to revise our attitude to abortion and - why not - begin to clamp down on all moves towards euthanasia
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen as shadow draftsman for the ppe group in the committee on research i should like to comment on some of the amendments which secured a majority
we should be guided by the same thinking that produced the first nordmann report and inspired the working group
the effects of future changes should also be managed from within and it is important to convince the workers of this fact
the successful management of this issue will require cooperation and solidarity from all member states
perhaps we have to look at more funding for the upgrading of tourist facilities and marketing the lengthening of the season in those northern climes that do not necessarily have assured sunshine
and ireland is now one of the likeliest qualifiers for emu
the outcome is decidedly not as good as it might have been and it has created confusion
getting stuck in a traditional military political viewpoint does not benefit us
priority should be given to an ifor-style peace-keeping force of the kind we have in bosnia and to a eu planning and analysis unit
we support budgetary discipline and solidarity
it is strange that we should be debating the broad economic policy guidelines since by definition they cannot be discussed
the spectre of unemployment is undoubtedly that which most reduces confidence and consequently private consumption and investment
i say this having visited in the united states last week the institute for missing and exploited children
i believe as i have said that we need a centralized system
if so could it indicate where this principle is enshrined in the treaty of rome
as presidency we will be fully supportive of proposals for the introduction of treaty language on transparency in the context of the current igc
as far as the nineteen ninety seven budget is concerned there are signs that it is indeed a question of not wanting to
last year the court ruled against the european parliament on the matter of compulsory and noncompulsory expenditure
for many years it has emerged that the commission has always grossly overestimated requirements
the outcome i think clearly will be further delay and damage to the european union 's reputation in south africa
another variant i have just heard mentioned would be not to have a debate only a vote
according to the dayton accords they should long ago have been brought before the tribunal in the hague
dialogue and requests are leading nowhere
those who criticize are silenced
today and for the time being the commission has no intention of opening such an office

i read in agence europe on 1 april that the council of agriculture ministers appears to have detected this schizophrenia and is drawing up measures to improve the coordination of the union 's trade and policy actions
because it is obvious from today 's debate that the situation is still unclear particularly as regards the octs
i think it is essential not to stay centred on one set policy only
madam president i myself was one of the people affected by the blockade imposed against the provider access for all because my homepage containing information on europe was no longer accessible to many german users of the internet
so it is a marvellous tool and as an old liberal our rapporteur tells us about the difficulties facing legislators required to regulate such phenomena
my first draft text was finished by the end of november nineteen ninety six and a full five months later we are discussing this report in the plenary
the basic aim was to issue recommendations to the member states on how to make small and medium-sized undertakings more efficient
and finally my fifth point is that smes must be given easier and improved access to international markets
however funding is the very lifeblood of smes so the matter will not go away for long
we support this proposal but we would also like to draw attention to the fact that it is not only ships in transit which are the problem
a cynical comment but it shows their frustration with the system
we now have 17.5 of households living below the poverty line and one in three children live in poverty in the uk
this report has the virtue of solving this problem by proposing that we set up through inclusion in the treaty a legal base which provides for the specific treatment of these regions
to this end i put down three amendments to a b and c on behalf of the liberal group and i hope and am confident that commissioner bonino as representative of the european commission will accept these amendments
on the contrary the euratom-usa agreement seems to allow for expansion of the plutonium processing industry which is wholly unsatisfactory
you will be aware that the commission has submitted a number of proposals to the intergovernmental conference
the president of chile promised in talks with sir leon brittan that he would correct the government bill to bring it in line with wto regulations
the key to unlocking enterprise is by putting in the double lock procedure that has been suggested of a greater fiche d 'impact assessment which should begin with our legislative review and secondly personal commission responsibility
is the commission going to propose an extension of the directive to coincide with this particular regulation and is it prepared to review the ceiling for the seventh shipbuilding aids directive
parliament has consistently opposed this practice of attempted legislation in secret
mahern report a4-413 97
in the area of jobs and the environment an increase in capacity is also effectively taking place
this is the really weak point in the union
the question again is thus whether it is not more sensible to look at compliance
perhaps we should also look to tighten up these 200 laws further but first and foremost we must insist on compliance
i therefore very much welcome the house 's proposal that legal acts should be drawn up during the lifetime of this parliament
i must also thank him for his willingness to accept amendments he has accepted a variety of amendments which i myself have tabled and the committee has discussed and approved
it is not the subject of the dispute between the european union and the united states
the question arising from the outset was how particularly in the light of the sectoral directive can we guarantee reciprocity
the fate of leo tindemans ' report provides a perfect illustration of that deplorable state of affairs
these are my brief remarks today
who are they
recent reports suggest that the unhcr has been able to extend somewhat the area in which it is active but thousands of refugees are being found in a seriously weakened condition there
as the time available for question time to the council has run out questions nos 11 to 29 will be answered in writing
we all need the support of public opinion when it comes to energy problems
because the costs are huge for the environment for public health and also for national budgets
the vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
the seventh point is that the seriousness of sanctions varies too much from one member state to another
the point is mr provan that the date of 1 june coincides with the organization of elections in france which was not known when the program was settled
as far as cross-border co-operation is concerned the interreg programs of the 95-99 period represent a substantial advance over those for the previous period especially as regards borders where no co-operation existed before nineteen ninety
the minutes were approved
nevertheless we have asked our services to look at the situation closely to make sure that the money allocated to us was properly used and did not help to swell mr mobutu 's bank accounts
i wished to mention this specifically because it is one of the permanent features of the european council
but i understand very well - i too would be afraid to appear before the elected representatives of the people of europe and present them with the likely results of the current intergovernmental conference
in my opinion there is a much greater danger of the house ending up like sancho panza - who was content simply to complain to hang back eating his lunch and to stretch himself out under the trees
the legal means that are currently available to the commission are plainly inadequate to enable it to play its full role as guardian of the treaties
i am asking a good deal of the house but i know how keen you are to see the single market fully completed
the structural funds have been cited as a potential source of housing finance
the main aspects of the regulation are the following
that was all in the interests of free enterprise
mr president i wish to say something about paragraph 12
i do not think so
how this can be achieved without a torrent of legislation at both european and member state level remains to be seen
that is why we speak to you today with mixed feelings
not just europe 's unity but also its competitiveness is at stake here
that is why the stability pact is so important
we are all in favor of the market as a necessary economic phenomenon for dynamism without its being an absolute
this is a very crucial phrase
otherwise he will be stung by this parliament
it is not the first time these questions have been raised
thirdly i am ready to try and find with an open mind solutions in those areas where this is possible
i hope we can change it but that is the case in countries with high unemployment
mr president you are casting me into despair here because when i get a question from a member of the house - three of them - which the president allows i have to answer
mr caudron has the floor for a supplementary
our proposals fall within the agriculture guideline
with regard to the proposed postponement of the oilseed payments the latest information on the implementation of the nineteen ninety seven budget makes it clear that adequate savings would probably be achieved
how can producers plan their activities in such conditions
but since i have done it once i will not repeat it
the money has to be found somewhere
one reason i find that disappointing is that i have made a mistake in my own judgement of human nature - i took you for a pragmatist a stubborn one certainly but still a pragmatist
approval of the minutes
they will rightly make it possible to involve the european parliament fully in the adoption of measures aimed at by article 129 extended to the veterinary and plant health areas
a word on the stability pact now the subject of discussion for several days
both the council and the commission seem determined to drive forward in a belief that only they know best
it is caught between those like me who believe we should learn to walk before we run and those who believe that we should be thrown in the deep end and either sink or swim
i should be very pleased if it were to be proved possible to achieve a result here
this is a question we can talk about
this is unacceptable the texts condemn all these subjects to unanimity
applause in view of this important change on the part of the british government will the socialist group agree to withdraw amendment no 50 so that we can adopt paragraph 8 undiluted
furthermore as has already been said the united states have interfered on several occasions in situations that we ought to have been able to solve alone
i find it somewhat ironic that we refer to the common foreign and security policy
this report despite its undeniable documentary quality and the wealth of its facts and figures is no exception to that rule
first with the transfer of competence from national to community level we have the reversal of a situation which traditionally depended on executive power relative to legislative power
the council shares this vision which emerges from the action plan
i agree with those who say that a lot can be done to improve co-operation between the existing legal systems but i am also convinced that we must be open to change where this is required
in sweden as in belgium the social responsibilities of major undertakings are under discussion
you would like to know the netherlands ' point of view as a member state of the european union
i hope that can take place as soon as possible and i can assure you that the commission will continue to press for that to happen
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
animal welfare in my view is not incompatible with sustaining the way of life and livelihood of many indigenous peoples - indeed i believe they are mutually complementary
if we adopt this tomorrow by more than 75 of those present will you accept that we have the legitimate democratic right to disagree with your opinion
the commission 's proposed budget increase of 5.9 is utterly inadequate and takes no account either of real demand or of the extension of the program to cover the associated countries
of course we can accept that amendment
i would also add that the countries of central and eastern europe can already benefit from the phare programs
we have a lot of votes to get through
in successive votes parliament adopted sixteen legislative resolutions
for years the colombian government 's stock response has been an apologetic shrug of the shoulders
mr president none of the states of the former yugoslavia seem to have understood the necessity of keeping to agreements including the dayton agreement and respecting human rights
perhaps we are dealing with a precedent here as a result of which the co-decision procedure will become the main decisionmaking process in the fisheries sector
as for the content of this report the proposal contains two decisions
norwegian salmon exporters will undertake to sell into the european union market above an agreed minimum price per kilo
in the field of information and communications technology the development of standards is - and in my view must be - market driven
of course that subject is relevant to the information society too
we assert our right to develop and continue developing our own food culture and it does not include hormones
what we ask therefore is that the dispute procedure should be carried forward to its conclusion to the appeal stage in other words and the whole of our group is ready to support the commission
how can this be improved
let me also ask the commission to introduce more educational measures in this field to monitor expenditure and perhaps also to make the award of contracts and the evaluation more transparent
a solution has been found to the problems of the united kingdom ireland and denmark
can the president-in-office confirm this particularly for those areas where the council is to continue to decide unanimously and where parliament is to keep its powers of codecision as indicated in the official document we have been given
i believe this is where parliament comes in and where it has a pioneering role to play
even though in this area the amsterdam text is sufficiently ambiguous to lend itself to restrictive interpretation
we certainly applaud this positive thrust and we will back it but that is not all
the dutch presidency did what it could and deserves congratulations if only for managing to hold together 15 member states with different problems
fourthly you should not harbor any exaggerated expectations
there was one question or rather a concern that was raised by a number of speakers to which i must reply relating to the scope of the codecision procedure
mr blot you may now speak
i have already explained why the agenda has been changed
but we have to recognize that bureaucracies and administrations do not deal with simple tasks
it is if you like part of the law governing competition
one or two questions come to mind
they claim that this interpretation is the only proper technical solution and that all other suggestions are based not on technical considerations but on sentiment
firstly even experimentation with embryos is despicable and offends against public policy and morality
in my view we political decision-makers ought to be far more critical of the promises which are made regarding the millions of jobs which will be created in this field
i cannot quite see from the report - and i am referring primarily to the report by mr.w.g.van velzen - that a common prefix within the eu will automatically result in lower costs and better service
now we have this package made up of apparently technical reports and one on competition rules which head in the same direction that concerns us and that we have denounced
secondly universal service obligations seen as a burden should not be transformed into a means of financing private companies benefiting already from the liberalization of the sector
it seems to me evident that events of recent weeks make it plain just how far behind we are
visas themselves are actually issued in the individual member states
on 29 april the dutch authorities suspected that 1 650 tonnes of meat sold by a belgian company named tragexgel stored in vlissingen constituted illegal exports of beef from the uk
we cannot afford to be blind to reality
you now want a new change to be made to the agenda
i should add that we also need to have an overview of the situation in order to tackle the future of community actions
da for far too long europe has been powerless to act as regards legislation to regulate the production of medicines based on biotechnological inventions
for that reason it is counterproductive to perpetuate through any kind of declaration or speculation the uncertainties that are now holding up expansion in europe
the other great challenge for your presidency mr president-in-office is the enlargement of the union
the historic nature of this task calls on us i think to refrain from taking a grocer-shop approach to the cost of that enlargement
that would then free the debate and focus it on questions of great importance for our future in particular working out the monetary organization the institutions and enlargement
mr president-in-office i want to comment on just one aspect the harmonization of taxation
as regards the operation of the internal market the truth is mr president that there continue to be violations of the concept of a single market specifically in the area of the free movement of goods
apart from that there is also the question of qualified majority voting
words must be turned into deeds into substantive action
those amendments were rejected by the council so that conciliation became inevitable
let us not see half the width of the sea between saying and doing in the environmental sector
sometimes the commission stands up and gives an impressive tally of the number of amendments that have been accepted and they all amount to minor wording changes
even so i believe that voluntary environmental agreements can only be developed and concluded as a supplement to environmental legislation but not as a substitute for it
commissioner you are recommending contractual voluntary agreements
we therefore urge the commission to take the necessary steps for their immediate establishment
let us hope that its inclusion in the eaggf guarantee section as you told us yesterday is not a sign that rural policy is being subordinated too much to the old cap which we want to change
its purpose is to increase the knowledge and dissemination of works representative of the member states ' culture
on the jarzembowski report a4-0243 97
i do not think so
madam president it has already been mentioned here that finland and greece have not signed the brussels agreement or declaration on a complete ban on landmines
i shall mention three important examples
i believe that we are currently witnessing a period of european construction
mr president today 's debate is linked almost seamlessly with agenda two thousand ninety seven and virtually obliges us to pre-empt some of its content
the vote will take place on wednesday at 12 noon
because i am watching the clock i shall summarize in a few words what has quite correctly been said during part of the discussion
on your first point we will correct the minutes
this is an important discussion both because of the issue and because of the comprehensiveness of the debate and it is important not just for us
progress has been made and we should recognize that
violence against women
thank you mr president and thank you too mr commissioner for your attendance and for your answers this afternoon
why has the commission not done it
if i have understood the commission properly during the montreal conference that ends tomorrow it will also put forward proposals to prohibit the sale and use of all cfcs worldwide
the contraband cfcs that have been discovered are surely a mere fraction of what is being smuggled into the union
mr president
this is a poor figleaf for the total absence of concessions on the american side
i believe that this last point is very important and i am delighted at the statement by the president of the council
i have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 2 of the rules of procedure
when there is a lack of unanimity it is very difficult to come to a conclusion
for this reason i believe that decisive measures need to be taken
i refer to the amendment attempting to re-introduce a concept long thought to be extinct a prohibition of finance for environmental groups that have been sentenced by the courts
moreover the rapporteur agrees by proposing a sub-section 3a to ensure financial control of the funded organizations
for this amendment to be put into operation at all member states must test for emissions according to a unified procedure to be laid down in this directive
on an economic level the situation is on balance positive
it is in this way that a true community foreign policy will be born
but it should just be clarified
it considers that eu-asean dialogue should be an occasion for examining the situation in this country
quite the contrary i shall demand at the employment summit in luxembourg a marked increase in leonardo funding because this is exactly what gives currently unemployed young people the means of getting jobs
mr president on a point of order
this is what it says
i think we should note that this step towards elections was a very important one towards making this country achieve of peace
it is also crucial to press the ethiopian government to release the political prisoners and prisoners of conscience and take steps to correct the procedures of an unjust legal system
it is even more serious than in tibet
at any rate i am sure we will keep coming back to this situation because of the importance of kenya and because of the importance of that country to the region as a whole
the situation shows clearly that the measures should be addressed at source and monitoring should concentrate on the production of beef and the cattle feed industry
this will take time because there is no magic wand in this area
anyone who considers that to be socially unacceptable must be consistent and remove the emu from their list of priorities
that process began in nineteen eighty two when the convention was signed and went on to its coming into force in nineteen ninety four with the initial ratification by 60 member states
with regard to cooperation the community has showed its willingness to contribute to a lasting development in laos and an improvement in the living conditions of the people of laos
basically this is because most of the financial aid programs being carried out in cambodia affect important rural and peasant areas
we should not reproach this country for failings in the reform process because logic dictates that when there is external pressure it is incredibly difficult to carry out internal reforms at the same time
but heavy threats weigh against the continuation of this policy
i must say that the european commission with the powers that it possesses is looking at that and is helping but it does not possess that many powers to intervene
the eu must aim to end the transportation of animals for slaughter once and for all as it causes the animals stress and suffering
finally i demand that all member states incorporate the directives in force as part of its national law and i mean those five countries which have still not done so
as long as we do not realize that animals are not goods maintained just for our profit nothing will change here
but there is still too little action from industrial quarters
yet we are doing nothing to change it
in parliament 's proposed solutions internal market competition is safeguarded in law and designs are sufficiently protected
mr president the role of the legislator is to draw up texts which are accurate balanced and clear in order to avoid perpetual legal arguments and disastrous economic effects on the sectors concerned
mr president i rise to speak on the point raised by mr coates which is to be found on page 6 of the minutes
when emu begins we will need a more effective employment policy than before in order that european growth can continue and that prosperity can be divided equally
it is brought painfully home to us in what i sometimes refer to as the ' statistics of shame ' of the european labor market
we did all of this before
we are now continuing on this road totally blindly without making any other changes when we see we are heading in the wrong direction
luckily amongst the positive points there has been at the request of left wing governments and the government of france the announcement of a luxembourg summit totally dedicated to employment
but as far as the principles are concerned we fully share them
that has already happened and uclaf has been requested to help in some individual investigations
this position was interpreted in a commission communication in nineteen ninety three
mr president this is a very serious matter
it will doubtless be difficult to begin negotiations with everyone on the same day and they will not be completed on the same day for all either
by sharing its currency a country is sharing power
europe is pan-european
at all events mr president i shall soon be reaching the end of my brief intervention
this will translate into the granting of substantial economic assistance through the european investment bank
our idea is to create space for the council of ministers to also make such decisions when a mass refugee situation arises
mr president seldom has a draft directive led to so many problems as the one the commission has now submitted to us
she asks that only tropical fats should be permitted as alternative fats and that the directive should not be allowed to enter into force until it is clear that that 5 can be determined really accurately
this is what mr lannoye 's report calls for
of course not
the truth is quite simple
to do anything other would mean that you call ' whisky ' any sort of rot-gut which has been distilled outside scotland or ireland
could the commissioner confirm that she is rejecting all the amendments except the seven which she has said she is accepting
however the council believes that dialogue is the only way forward to a durable solution
subject classification of schengen manuals
i was with mrs banotti who was canvassing in my home town yesterday
you are already aware of the matter
finally we should support amendment no 27 but not amendment no 26
the proposal does not however impose any requirements on the holding companies as such
i believe that it is important that we on a question which is so fundamentally to do with democracy are more successful in publicising what we are talking about the society which we are trying to build
our group does not support mrs breyer 's amendment on labeling to the extent that labeling within this guideline is to be achieved with additives
the same applies to metatartric acid used in grape juice - i personally come from languedoc roussillon - to ensure its acidity
this proposal does not form part of the commission 's proposal and it is difficult in our opinion for the house to go back on its own decision
approval of the minutes
i would like that to be recorded as well
it is a waste of money for parliament to move between brussels and strasbourg
however i am guided mainly by listening to the consumer interest the trade aspects and the countries ' cultural background where chocolate is concerned
the european union cannot in fact accept that the congolese president is defying the entire international community and preventing a united nations mission from investigating accusations made against the kinshasa government for making indiscriminate massacres in eastern zaire
but if that does not happen we must never tire
the effect of the irresponsible and unacceptable role of some slovak institutions is to isolate slovakia even more and as some of the speakers before me have emphasized this is to the detriment of the slovak people
the most important thing for the moment though is that quick and satisfactory help is immediately given to those people who are affected
the form of this project will be discussed next week in manaus amazonia during the fourth meeting of the participants in the pilot program
that is a main cause of worry for the press
thank you very much mr commissioner
what is needed is a global solution through the un or the wto - i do not know which is most appropriate
i hope he will support mrs seillier 's two amendments
has there been any follow-up on what measures the presidency is going to take to ensure that there will be no recurrences of this
with respect to the vote on the daskalaki report most of the uk labor members while supporting the thrust of this report have reservations about paragraph 12
we ought to know
the commission justifies itself by saying that export refunds would not be paid if the welfare rules were broken
the commission hopes that these grubbing up measures will facilitate the cleaning up of the sector in the long term so that it can make full use of the reforms to the common organization of the market
without committing itself finally at this stage the commission will introduce it into the final discussion
that completes our agenda and i wish you a happy weekend
i am grateful for the opportunity to report to the house on the french road haulage strike and related issues
madam president it is impossible to speak while all my colleagues are chatting among themselves
this is an issue which should be urgently placed on parliament 's agenda
the report proposes that tacs should be established on the basis of biological and socioeconomic factors and calls for the reduction of discards and the use of selective fishing gear
one more point and i can deal with it very quickly is amendment no 8
phare
the possibility if they so wish to have national representation on those coins and notes is an extremely important step to achieve public acceptability in the early stages
i think the sub-committee on currency has made a constructive suggestion to compensate for the lack of judicial competence with regard to bank notes
first on the fact that the european parliament wishes to be informed of the activities of this regulatory committee set up under article 8
i share that view because state pension systems have the advantage of being the same for men and women
the debate has demonstrated a clear consensus on a number of points
parliamentary democracy has nothing to gain when it lets the emotions of public opinion carry more weight than the principles underlying democracy.3.the political responsibility of a politician ends with his mandate
it is not on the agenda and it is not a matter for the part-session
mr president i am very glad parliament has decided to discuss climate change during this sitting on the basis of mr linkohr 's report and mr pimenta 's resolution on climate change
it is only in this way that our universities can continue to withstand the pressure of international competition
these meetings of the rules committee must be really exciting
the time for which i was allowed to speak to you is over
it lends weight to parliament 's argument that the compulsory side of the budget should disappear
you asked how it looks with the gross national product component
whenever someone is given money his human spirit becomes inventive
now it is often the case that people only do something about an epidemic once it is upon them and that reduces the interest in fighting it
in this document the different possibilities for improving its ways of working are analyzed as far as professional shortcomings financial irregularities fraud and corruption are concerned
scientific proof of transmission from animals to human beings is presented and that is not worrying
i would like to tell mrs roth-behrendt that she is wrong and that this mistrust of the agriculture council is not justified
so we cannot accept the cancellation of national subsidies after two thousand ninety six as proposed by the commission
so i would ask mr cox to summarize what he said in his speech a short while ago and send that comment to the president either through me or directly
we have learned that if we give priority to precautionary health and consumer protection and if we practice sustainable agriculture in earnest and not just in sunday speeches this change can regain people 's trust for us
the problem of the european company we know is that its stumbling block is the place of workers within the company
likewise his reference to the need for haste after decades of discussion is surely right and i also think that the inclusion of the european co-operative associations in the proposal is necessary
however i believe that the most important person to talk to is helmut kohl
thank you for your comments mr president
finally there is one amendment that the commission cannot support
it is actually quite true that structural funding and cohesion funding are small items compared to national economic policy and what emu is going to bring along with it
specifically it was this directive about the free practice of the profession of lawyer
her task has not been an easy one as the need for the motion had initially been strongly opposed
they still have a very long road to travel
but the important thing is that the seed the possibility exists
more than anything else the question of unemployment directly affects the life of millions of european citizens
mr president within the framework of the treaty of amsterdam governments were mandated to rethink the union on the eve of enlargement
amsterdam was above all a vain attempt in the face of necessary institutional reforms
at the october sitting during the debate on the state of the union we said that amsterdam was a big disappointment today we would like to add that it was a lost opportunity
i should like this to be recorded
we will ensure that all the language versions are correct and these important distinctions are adhered to
to merge objective 3 and objective 4 in order to concentrate solely on re-education and training appears panicky
that is the historic failure of the governments not europe but the governments
it leads to veto positions in areas where we need movement
i understand that a new euratom directive no 96 29 on radioactive waste has been adopted and will become law in the member states by may two thousand ninety five
the directive supplements the general data protection directive as regards the protection of privacy in view of the technical facilities available to the latest telecommunications networks
carrier preselection is an excellent way for the consumer to benefit in the short term from the european liberalization policy
it can be regarded as a first step in our efforts to tackle the serious crime threat and to confront the anxieties of our citizens
finally can i say that the british labor members in this parliament will be able to support all these reports with the solitary exception of the second report from mr orlando where we will have to abstain
the individual citizen affected by europol 's activities must have the right to knowledge of that data and the right to control its availability
note not ' knowledge ' but ' foreseeable knowledge ' - a very peculiar notion indeed of guilt by our standards of justice
a minimum amount of political stability and sufficient security are of course necessary before we can see how reintegration and development can be stabilized and implemented
this again was mentioned this week in the auditors ' report which stated that there had not been a proper definition by the member states of additionality or cofinancing
i do believe in the main that in order to defend european individuality and diversity the fight we must fight is the modern equivalent of civilization 's struggle against barbarity
it depends on the quality of their dedication and the quality of their public administration and their government
generations before us have longed for this
what are the consequences of the treaty of amsterdam for the union 's budget
it should not be forgotten that many of them have had the door shut in their faces twice as they were not allowed to join nato either
a process of transformation and structural change is required particularly in agriculture in the coal and steel industry and in the removal of environmental destruction
therefore we are opposed to any delay or conditions imposed on the start of negotiations with cyprus which should begin at the same time as with the other countries and involve the legitimate government in nicosia
however whatever changes may come about mr president and whatever the debate on cutbacks and on internal changes in the context of the financial perspectives they must concern all areas and not focus on a few
this is totally unacceptable
i feel personally very strongly about this issue
in belgium a founder member of the union there is a free press but one that is subsidized by the powers that be on condition that it is politically correct that is supportive of the system
human rights
it is important that the applicant countries are not set up against each other
but it is our duty and it is in our own interests to have the new countries admitted as quickly as possible
in order for economic and monetary union genuininely to walk on two legs economic coordination must not be limited to enabling a policy from the central bank which is directed at stability
it is well known that by far the most significant part namely 30 billion belgian francs is set aside for the province of henegouwen as an objective 1 region
europe cannot compete in the world in terms of wages but ultimately only on productivity
countries would rather battle against trafficking in women against illegal immigration than against the most brutal violation of human rights
that is why we have asked the postal services concerned to submit to us an agreement on improved terminal dues obviously within the union not as part of the international rules
until the liberalization of cross-border post tariffs should be set according to the first reims agreement since in this the increase in tariffs is related to an improvement of service provision
you can use nuclear energy and the euratom treaty allows large amounts of money for the safe use of nuclear energy
all those things we still need to thrash out
here i have in mind the members of the research committee in general and the rapporteurs and members of the ten other associated committees
a sectorial discipline-based approach is on occasion a tempting one
in short what remains is to keep to the idea of an outline energy policy program and to strengthen energy policy actions through cooperation between the member states
their chances would be reduced
the notion of a people 's europe where social cohesion and economic growth are dependent upon the delivery of good services right across the community underpins this report
this applies not only to the traditional post but also to radiotelephony the internet etcetera
mr president the process of liberalization and of deregulation implemented at community level imperils public services and has had negative consequences on employment and social conditions without in any way benefitting users
the offer made to turkey is concrete and substantial whatever ankara 's disappointed reaction
but if the employment summit was a success last weekend 's summit was a truly historic event
with regard to this too we have after long discussions and negotiations and many contacts and trips found an adequate formula
i would like to underline just one point the importance of the eu policy towards the ukraine
because of what the treaty of amsterdam says about transparency consolidation and codification have become one of the commission 's political priorities
thanks to that power of initiative we can for example request to council that proposals should be put to the vote as happened during the last few weeks with the robert schuman action and tobacco advertising
personally i think that this exercise could be crucial for the democratic functioning of the european union for it is essential for a parliament which following the treaty of amsterdam is now called to become a full colegislator
so this commission is in place for five years with its bureaucracy even more immovable and untouchable than itself
i am not in favor of creating new institutions new structures
we held a very long debate to discuss the matter but at the end of the debate the college 's position was not clear
i thank the president-in-office for his very short and curt reply
employment policy because when there are 750 000 people employed and tree subsidies are requested it is in your interest to save 85 of your costs by no longer maintaining your olive grove
they will be killed by diseases of the heart or lungs or by cancer because they inhale tobacco smoke
there is also need for an effective and comprehensive ban on advertising
i now have two requests to raise points of order
is an advertising ban the answer
as an austrian i am perhaps very sensitive about the idea of a state like the one we share a border with which has forbidden everything
it is all a question of semantics
we will gauge the value of enlargement in relation to the world 's poor people and nations
and i find what we have heard unacceptable
thank you mr president
it is questionable whether that is the most pressing measure in the area of energy in europe
i find this attitude dangerous destabilizing and unacceptable the more so because the union has in no way fulfilled its obligations under the customs union
but it is in the interests of neither the union nor turkey to allow the relationship to deteriorate further
this is really the first matter which concerns me namely the ratification of the agreement by the us senate
i believe that points 6 and 8 of our resolution are of particular importance
mr president burundi has by now become a classic example of the destabilizing effect of arms supplies

these decisions would be worrying enough under normal circumstances but they become alarming when they are taken by people who are merely temporary stand-ins

against this background the commission gave an undertaking in its medium-term social action program to submit a draft recommendation on the reciprocal recognition by member states of a parking card for people with disabilities
i hope with this regulation we can move a little closer to the objectives i have just stated
from this point of view we must be pleased as all the allocations initially provided for have been committed not just those for nineteen ninety six but also those for nineteen ninety four reincorporated into the budget
the commission has taken note of the report in question
furthermore the commission will submit a proposal for a new regulation aimed at creating a unified framework for budgets and procedures
in his intervention he spoke about the council changing its approach and dealing with five member states as if somehow that was an act of planning
just as we have started to look into consumers ' rights in their home country we should also place an emphasis on the rights of those consumers on holiday

question no 45 by marialiese flemming h-0227 98
we cannot do that just yet because six member states have yet to notify us of the implementation measures
a european network on family at work established by the commission in nineteen ninety four has also been engaged in promoting family-friendly employment policies
however in view of the fact that we lost several minutes on points of order i have asked parliament 's services if they would be kind enough to allow us to extend question time by ten minutes
we have tried to find an agreement which everyone would respect and provided this agreement was ratified we were ready to immediately put an end to the 7th directive

progress in russia is unpredictable often chaotic following no western model or timetable
dutch politicians and certainly the dutch parliament have as far as i know never formally tried to exert influence over the bank
let me give you an example
the 26 countries also agreed a statement on kosovo and they decided to set up an expert group on drugs and crime which we are taking forward urgently
the central government of bosnia is still incapable of acting
in nineteen ninety six and nineteen ninety seven they were either non-existent or ineffective
the council took the decision for very practical reasons the situation was urgent
firstly i believe that in principle donations must remain voluntary
i wish to thank mr cabrol for his contribution and also those others who have contributed this evening
making policies always involves making decisions
it seems that everything is going so well and that is good
i would like to promote restructuring in the research budget modern energy-saving technologies which lead to a real breakthrough
i just want to add one thought and i say it with great respect to you madam president as something you can take back to the bureau
the vote will take place today at 12.00 noon
the rules of procedure in their current form and interpretation give us to understand that the subcommittees of which there are three in this parliament can only be composed of full or substitute members of the main committee
the cabrol report of course addresses a major problem namely that of the safety of the supply of blood donations in europe
firstly i utterly reject the statement that discussion has taken place between a coalition of hardline extremists - to paraphrase mr voggenhuber
mr president must we remain loyal to our single market principles come what may or are we interested in people as well
the existing system permits geographical positioning and navigation control in all modes of transport
in other words madam commissioner there has been a repetition of what happened in bosnia where it appears that the european commission is the only donor to have so far contributed anything
neither us nor eu legislation allows for such procedures to be deferred or broken off
in this way the agreement represents a significant development in relations between the eu and the usa
so today in this house we rejoice in the progress that is being made
when faced with this i have to say that if the only thing we achieved was peace in northern ireland the european union would have been worthwhile
the commission has taken every opportunity of stating this and in particular we will insist on this point in the new broad guidelines for nineteen ninety eight economic policy
all the issues raised by the five honorable members today are highlighted as areas of activity within that plan
i share the rapporteur 's view that it would have been good if the court of justice had been given greater scope to give preliminary rulings
the future city of culture must submit itself for selection directly without having to go through central government
i know that you do not accept this because as commissioner you want to oversee the actual procedures
he recommended changes in taxation and social security payments to put balance back into the relationship between labor and capital the latter always being more valued recompensed and favored to the detriment of workers and producers
nevertheless europe could act to support growth and employment on a larger scale in at least three ways
the work was slipshod
we will contribute decisively to ensuring that the union has a real common economic policy and strong representative political institutions
we should not be in any hurry to change fiscal policy as it would have a substantially adverse effect on community peace and employment
the euro must be used to create a social europe and the union should dissociate itself from neo-liberal thinking that would harm the structure of a social europe
madam president i feel like someone standing on the quayside waving farewell to the beautiful unsinkable titanic
this also emerges from the report which speaks of increased coordination of taxation systems and tax rates
a single currency can therefore represent a significant step towards overcoming nationalism
i would therefore be very grateful mr president if you could do something to find out why the air france flights have been canceled
if it should become clear that it is really necessary to revise the trips agreement i shall certainly be one of those calling for it to be revised and for the directive to be changed
that is why there are some amendments to the common position which we simply must accept
so today we are discussing our own text
the first question in my opinion ought not to be asked at all why is it actually necessary that banking institutions be subject to a notification procedure before they set up in another member state
they have become guinea-pigs for unscrupulous profiteers
compared to the ceiling of total payments in the financial perspectives of 1.24 this represents virtual savings of some 11 billion euros for the member states in nineteen ninety nine alone
may i suggest that we pause for a moment
one unnecessary death from smoking is one too many if we can prevent the deceptive peddling of the products which may cause it
i think that if we support this ban there will be quiet relief right across europe
it relates to the definition of points of compliance
i have made my views clear on the lobbying activities of some people associated with the copper industry
we have tried to remove the ambiguities there
given that the disinfection of water is particularly good business for the chemical industry it will be important in future to ensure that the addition of chemicals is kept to an absolute minimum
as far as the commission 's services can ascertain the who has not changed its stance so far
nonetheless the commission 's overall attitude is that the commission must defend its own proposal at first reading before the house
we call in the report for a process whereby technical development and convergence go hand in hand with a monitoring review of the way in which these different services operate
mr president firstly we need to applaud the commission for taking action as much as for its intentions it does not duck issues in a field where the community is not really competent to act
whether this will be enough to allow the whole population to benefit from the agreement is questionable
if we are talking about a serious opinion and if we are asked to give a thorough assessment of each individual candidate then a problem does arise
this shows the level of political stability we have achieved in europe today
here we are giving an opinion on people who are nominated for appointment to the european central bank
as a consumer i have the right to know which products are on the market and what these products offer
however blame for this must be shared with the member states where implementation of the first regulation was not a success
this is the only way the european label can assure increased competitiveness to products qualifying for the label
it only contains two innovations the incorporation into the cfsp of cooperation in the field of armaments and the petersberg missions
this burgeoning cooperation has already produced significant results
however there are areas of the report that i would disagree with
unlike many commentators on this subject minister i personally am not surprised
it is our firm desire to see that the federal republic of yugoslavia takes its rightful place in the european family of nations and plays a full part in the international community
just give people simplicity and clarity
so it will come as no surprise if reservations and criticisms are expressed by increasing numbers of people in all the member states
on the contrary we can only be pro-active in employing the greatest transparency the greatest possible openness and establishing simple structures and decision making procedures
our political group recognizes the importance of the overall consideration which has been given to this important topic and congratulates the rapporteur mr pex on the work which has been accomplished
i only mention the inauguration of the commission or the customs union with turkey
the nuclear plant is to go into operation in spite of the fact that internationally recognized experts consider that building a new installation would be more cost-efficient that refitting an old one to meet international safety standards
if we do not have the courage to say that then problems will only increase in future and i am thinking not least of the problem of the millions of turkish guest workers and temporary immigrants in europe
it is only one step but it is an important step
the most important thing now is to include high speed trains in this system so that people are better able to recognize those routes where it is more practical to take the train than to fly
this is perhaps something one would not normally think about in this context but this may actually be one of the most important steps towards a liberalized railway sector
in this context organized crime is increasingly perceived as a problem
we must also ensure that the proposed regulations put an end to existing distortions of competition within the single market
free access to gas is a key factor in profitability when it comes to constructing private or smallscale power stations
how do we make the europe that we are trying to build acceptable to the citizens
jobs are important but hitherto there has been too much talk and here i would agree with my colleague wim van velzen and not enough success
we are too vain to remain decently silent
the situation is to say the least not encouraging even if the president-in-office of the council endeavored with a measure of clarity and skill to illustrate what has been achieved
i agree with the rapporteur that we cannot just sit back and wait until a solution pops up out of the air while people are suffering substantial income loss through measures of this kind
as regards the proposal to establish call centres for migrant and frontier workers i would like to draw parliament 's attention to the commission 's intention to launch a permanent dialogue with citizens
mr president i consider that the regulation proposed by the european commission is most fortuitous for two reasons
i think that is wrong mr president
also progress is being made towards achieving a balance between the intervention sectors
i should remind you that by virtue of the concentration principle and in applying rigid technical guidelines the commission plans to exclude islands such as sardinia and corsica from the new objective 1
it is the difficulties of administration in brussels rather than the lack of effect on the ground which is besetting their progress
mr president i would draw your attention and through you the attention of the president and the bureau to remarks in the belgian press attributed to one of our members mr thierry jean-pierre
the commission has thus listened to parliament but has implemented - and may now on the council 's recommendation implement - the agreement they negotiated
thus amendment no 7 provides for a higher compensatory payment for areas set aside to be used for purposes other than food production
detailed work will continue in the remaining weeks of the uk presidency and then continue under the presidency of our austrian colleagues
we are just saying that at the moment it seems premature
i think his work shows that the agenda two thousand ninety eight document is tremendously unbalanced
how can we do this
this overlooks the particularly serious consequences for farmers of the disappearance of the green rate entailed in the transition to the euro
the commission 's revision proposals must not be restricted to concentration
the new objective 2 is unfortunately not logical madam commissioner
perhaps the most important message from glasgow is in my view that there was no fundamental opposition
this explains why in the context of the world trade organization a working party is looking into the problem of competition and trade with a view to making a number of suggestions
once again this question is being put to me by the honorable member and i am happy to reply to this question
we had to call in some experts
i hope therefore that they are quite clear we will not accept something which cuts the fifth framework program in real terms in comparison with the fourth
yet the united states is quadrupling the amount of support it gives to the supply and service industry in the oil sector
i would like to thank those of you who have highlighted the research dimension of the quality of life along with its social and societal dimensions for the aim of research is not only to increase competitiveness
this can clearly be seen in the concept of key actions an excellent instrument in this new approach to research which i am glad meets with the full approval of parliament
those messages in favor of the wto system were expressed by virtually all countries at the conference both developed and developing
i am pleased to see sir leon that you have taken the opportunity to make a statement when due to pressure of time we can neither reply to what you have said nor even really go into it
at present we have a mediator a great many governments and a commission office and that is the first issue we must tackle
we need to resolve the blockage that we have and the hardening of positions that seem to be adopted on both sides
tell me how to do that
in the coming months many of us will have to defend the idea of europe and also to state a number of home truths even if this means touching on some sore points
and what condition is that
for this will it be necessary to issue an international arrest warrant to arrest milosevic and to bring him before the international court in the hague
only then will it be fulfilling its mandate
mr president this report has followed a rather arduous course but it has at long last reached the final straight thanks amongst other things to the determination of the rapporteur
this constitutes anti-community tax competition in the form of tax dumping and is harmful to all the states in the european union
our view is similar to that just expressed by the council that the ideal thing would be to set up a computerized system
none of the plaintiffs therefore attended
albania has repeatedly declared its commitment to observe the rights of the greek minority in accordance with international standards
tax competition is inevitable in this sense
so i think it is becoming a matter of urgency to improve the coordination of these policies which are a hindrance to the proper working of the internal market
these aspects must clearly be the subject of further measures in particular at a national level
but we the existing members of the european union cannot on the one hand say that we support enlargement and then not will the means to achieve enlargement
the third way surely is to recognize that government has a vital role to play but one that is enabling empowering our people and business to prosper in a new global market
we consider the initiative by mr kohl and mr chirac to be an attack on a future-oriented european political project
applause
as currently framed they would be disastrous for irish agriculture and the towns and villages of rural ireland
mr president one cannot but lament the inconceivable - that eleven nuclear tests have been detonated in india and pakistan
it fosters a culture of ingenuity and solidarity whilst at the same time it nurtures the soil in which all manner of shady deals find sustenance
we must obtain a bilateral cease-fire as a matter of urgency as a pre-condition for negotiations but we must ensure that the current mediation initiatives do not suffer from excess or multiplication
parliament in its infinite wisdom has defined a new border in europe
many of us and many others too need to reflect on the road we have traveled on the reasons for the backward movement and on the apparent incompatibility and autism of those currently in power
two thirds of the total north sea contingent of horse mackerel has for example been allocated to denmark which processes this fish into fish meal
the business people concerned have even admitted as much
apple trees are being pulled up
the commission did respond to our request in the report by mr des places on the price package for a proposal on the set-aside requirement before the end of this month
environmental degradation in our towns and cities is as widespread as the problem of social dislocation
but the general fund that has finally been decided on has been agreed with the committee on agriculture
the commission should have presented the council with a report by nineteen ninety four on the functioning of this transitional system and on the related systems of vendor controls
madam president ladies and gentlemen we are so used to the thorough and committed approach of the rapporteur mrs fontaine that i have to say that there is almost nothing left to add
a complete solution must therefore also be global and can only be brought about in cooperation with the industry
even if i am not able to convince parliament of the commission 's position in all respects i hope i have at least clarified that position
in any case the eu must never be just an economic and monetary union
the rapporteur has taken this on board and i can only praise her for her commitment in this area
while some progress had been made in most sectors it was not sufficient and so last year the commission decided to publish the white paper setting out how we intended to take matters forward
we have subsequently confirmed this approach in the second-phase consultation documentation adopted by the commission on 31 march
unemployment affects built-up areas particularly badly
the measures suggested in the proposal for a resolution which has been submitted to us is obviously a step in the right direction
if we want to help third-country nationals improve their education we should promote this work attitude and remove obstacles
fundamentalism which exists in all sorts of religions internationally has been referred to and rightly so - as mr colajanni rightly says as a sort of misunderstanding
how can we get access to the international market when there are countries carrying on like that
in this respect mr wolf 's comments on the subject are being put into practical effect
the commission communication concentrates on legal possibilities and impossibilities while the point of lack of awareness remains untouched
it would probably have been preferable to demarcate the boundaries of the report more clearly this would have avoided some of the interminable discussions
they should converge but not be made identical
the fourth point i would like to make relates to supranational members of parliament
these difficulties are attributed inter alia to the need to adhere to the convergence criteria in respect of economic and monetary union
as far as social affairs go i did not hear a single word about fiscal harmonization which is one of your own finance minister 's ambitions
i do not want to discuss what should apply to cars and to the air with you today
we want to convey our thanks in this way
it is a major mistake
let us not be under any illusions
the olsson report does not allow us to achieve these objectives
the governing council also agreed on the framework for the organization of the overall testing of escb-wide systems and procedures which will be conducted in the remaining six months before 1 january
i would like to have a reply to this
i want to have an answer from the president-in-office before i ask my supplementary
as you know we have gained something from the socrates program
here a similar situation is presented
then it happens all at once
the new legislative proposals will cover key issues such as the improvement of the right of residence for job seekers and trainees and the reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for all workers
unfortunately i have now forgotten the very finesounding name
in conclusion i would like to acknowledge the remarkable work of the rapporteur mr rothley who has been able to bring clarity to a complex text and who has proven his great talent as a jurist
i finally come to the various amendments that the commission cannot accept because they do not in any way improve the text proposed and might create confusion regarding the meaning of some of the provisions
but that must not prevent us from studying the importance of the relationship between environmental protection and employment
i commend the evans and wibe reports to the house
and if they did not get justice who opposed them
to my mind it is important to realize that many of these complaints could be resolved easily and promptly at national level
allow me also to say something about our voting procedure
another indication is that the european court of justice has just given a ruling for the first time on the directive on the freedom of access to information concerning the environment
i am happy to back this report which seeks to make the petition system in the european parliament more accessible to our citizens
in the mean time rioting has understandably broken out in nigeria and that has led to violent incidents between police the military and demonstrators who are taking part on behalf of the opposition
a small instrument with an astounding effect
the other objective in the medium to long term is to promote a peace process that although certainly dangerous and difficult is also the only condition for development of this area
europe is a synthesis of tolerance and violence the holocaust did not arrive from another world unfortunately the holocaust arrived from within the history of europe
i fully support the european parliament resolution which demands restitution of stolen assets and i trust that the commission and the council will do everything within their powers in that area
newman report a4-0258 98
this has to be done on a global level for it is unacceptable that our european airlines should be disadvantaged in relation to american and other companies
now let me concentrate on three questions which will raise a more severe challenge
i would recommend anyone taking part in the forthcoming discussion to read it thoroughly
expectations that a european system would be immediately established go much too far and would not even be compatible with the political objectives of the action plan
firstly i would like to say that it relates to intergovernmental cooperation
twenty years ago fish was the cheapest dish on the menu
the members of this house and naturally of the congress too will play a central role in making these relations more intense
europe 's citizens above all hope for stability and reliability from transatlantic relations
freedom certainly for those who are listening to us on the echelon system
and why not
very little i believe and i therefore hope to be brief
the list of specific powers of the commission annexed to the agreement is correct
i believe that this is the real policy of the future industrial policy coupled with environment policy or rather environment policy which determines industrial policy
the result of the conciliation is a good one
examples would be the electric car and various types of hybrid vehicle capable of running off electricity in cities and built-up areas
not a directive but a regulation and in time stricter newer standards on aircraft noise
i believe that very strong pressure has to be kept up on burma 's military government
we demand that all funds for meetings should be placed in budget reserves and the money released once we have been given sufficient information
we are now seeking to prioritise projects to accompany the reforms which involves a certain amount of adaptation of our working methods
president santer has just acknowledged this as have several colleagues
russia needs some restoration work on its governmental administration systems and it needs structural aid
we must try to restore confidence through human contacts and by supporting the present government
there is no need to panic at the moment
customs union with turkey
madam president ladies and gentlemen the kosovo conflict still constitutes an extremely long-term threat to european security and stability interests
i should like you madam president-in-office and the commissioner to tell me how we can think of sending the refugees back to those villages which have been destroyed and occupied by milosevic 's troops
there is a precedent
madam president-in-office you said that armed intervention is unthinkable
thousands of young women are working as prostitutes in the member states of the eu
there is also the parallel problem of abkhazia in georgia or the problems in ossetia - in fact there are many problems but there are also some positive aspects
can you envisage a new legal basis for settling nuclear safety questions on a europe-wide basis in future
do n't worry we do n't break the law but we get results and we can prove it
in the light of the recently renewed debate on subsidiarity we should finally consider how far a pre-accession strategy of this kind can be transferred to the national level
one of the aims was to improve equal treatment on the labor market
it is therefore up to the member states whose role is pivotal to once again seize the initiative
the second reason i gave was that although turkey had made progress in the area of human rights much remains to be done
since kemal ataturk the army has always been regarded as the guardian of the turkish constitution and the secular nature of the state
no-one even mentions the western european union any more and the european union it has now become very clear sadly has no policy on africa
i shall be very interested to hear what you have to say to us
at no time did i feel threatened
are you not confusing - and perhaps this is the heart of the matter - homosexuality with paedophilia
it is an unpardonable crime against humanity and we have said time and time again that we must do something to stop it
they are huge areas but they are guarded and kept clean and they are protected by fire-breaks and fire-lanes
mrs marinucci had understood this very well she said that that was not what she wanted to see
the vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
closer cooperation between moldavia ukraine georgia azerbaijan and the central asian republics on establishing further economic links with europe will also play a part here
it seems to me that she can draw her conclusions from that
one point on which i think we must all agree is that corruption is a highly destabilising factor not only of our democratic structures but in a more obvious way of the free market and free competition
although the multiannual guidance program sets out certain important aims the member states must abide by these aims whilst at the same time carrying forward research
robin teverson and i have been working very closely together on this issue over the last months
our citizens and their elected bodies must have the means to control this central bank
the problem is however that to be covered by regulation no 1408 presupposes that the persons concerned already have the right to freedom of movement
this is the action program in which we have invited industry the member states and all the other relevant agencies to take initiatives with a view to collaborating in the promotion of renewable sources
then we might as well do the same and hold a european union referendum that switzerland would have to accept
in view of all these factors we believe that efforts should at last be made to find a legal base an appropriate program and appropriate budget lines and to recognize tourism as an issue in its own right
mr president i should like to mention in reference to the last comment that there is not a single direct flight from finland to strasbourg so i suggest we meet in brussels only
it demands an immediate halt to the violence and early negotiations to find a political settlement to the crisis
but then we have to actually do what we say
the committee on budgetary control had made similar statements on many occasions but they never really received any reaction
in my view the commission should have had the political courage to put forward proposals which would facilitate political progress
of course we have our contribution to make here but this is one of the main elements of the barcelona process and a great deal is being done in this regard too
there has never been a time in the history of this continent when peoples have not been moving from one place to another as a result of famine war scarcity poverty or persecution
the high volume of trade and movement of people ideas capital and goods is of vital importance for hong kong
it is not enough to say that sometimes as the president-in-office said the council cannot prevent occasional shortcomings
as for the croats the new member of the state executive antejelavic is going to organise a meeting of the party in october in order to reform the hdz
there are also strong supporters of it
it is therefore essentially a program to produce a list of pollutants and the diseases they cause
the curtailment of the scope and the duration of the program is particularly regrettable to me to say the least
we already have immense experience of countless cases of contracts where consumers have been taken in by misleading advertising or bad contracts
there are far more aspects to energy than just environmental aspects
it is not acceptable that all countries should pay so that a few can use nuclear energy instead we must lay further emphasis on moving away from this
but i believe there is a much more humane alternative to fortress europe which is at present on the european drawing board
the final outcome of such a moratorium must of course be the abolition of the death penalty
the sitting suspended at 5.45 p.m.was resumed at 6 p.m.
but the precise way in which these changes are to be implemented and more remarkably still the new conditions of service which will apply to new jet staff are not included in the commission proposal at all
i have to admit that the most recent report i have on the advice of the jet scientific council is a little bit difficult to understand
the next item is the statement by the commission on pigmeat
the present situation in europe and in the world must in fact result in a policy aimed at controlling production through a genuine common organization of the market
it brings us a step closer to completing the single market
the consumer wants to know what he is eating and farmers like to know what production standards they have to meet
i am not surprised because her dedication to the work of the committee on regional policy has been constant
i will either do it here if you will allow when he arrives or we will do it in our group
welcome
but how can you find a good farming practice that enables country-dwellers to survive
thirdly we need to give attention to the issue of biogas one way of practicing and developing agriculture while making use of something that pollutes our countryside
from a regulatory standpoint it will naturally be necessary to consider basing policy on proper scientific advice and to provide a means of responding quickly and effectively to specific concerns when evidence comes to light at short notice
we could doubtless support the call for measures in this area with the need to safeguard biological diversity
approval of the minutes
we are grateful to the committee on budgets and mr viola for this idea
if certificates are valid throughout the community people will after all tend to take the easiest option that is to say the easiest examination
few parliaments in europe would be prepared with this perspective to stay below the expenditure ceiling and the council and commission should realize this though often the council does not seem to do so
we want to use this to generate further momentum on jobs
i realize that the present council had nothing to do with the origins of the problem but i look to it and its immediate successor to make the members ' statute fair for members of this house
i am thinking in particular of conference tourism which is very important for jobs in our countries
a number of paragraphs in the resolution are addressed to the three institutions and i personally fully endorse the text
in my country alone austria 8 of the gross domestic product is apportioned to investments from abroad
but before that we need to have calculable and reliable values
but it is equally important that this system does not automatically result in a bonnet crammed full of electronics and that small and medium-sized companies continue to have access to these electronic steering devices
so mrs hautala 's amendment is more ambitious
if we achieve that we shall be on the way to getting environmental imperatives integrated into the transport sector
europe madam president is more than this
nothing else is acceptable
particular importance will be given to the safety of the observers on the ground
mr president madam president-in-office i am not as quick as the previous speaker to see progress where there is none
violence must only be used to combat violence as the very last resort
mr president i endorse my colleagues ' assessment of the agreement and their denunciation of the crimes committed and i hope that we shall not have to wait 25 years to bring that criminal to justice
on 5 october the world bank therefore approved loans of usd 5.7 billion to reassure investors and because foreign banks were hesitating to provide argentina with the necessary resources
following the debt crisis latin american countries have in recent years made a considerable political and economic effort towards structural adjustment
mr bangemann it is regrettable that year after year the commission should propose the same amounts for the main budget lines for latin america
the experience of many countries over many years should vouch for the use of substitute materials
this is an important initiative within the community 's efforts to guarantee better protection of workers from the risks related to carcinogens at work
these carry with them a high emotional charge and tend to be seen as the safest form of emergency reserve for an independent nation
on the other hand we have to look at whether we are getting enough for the money we spend
mr santini 's report deals comprehensively with the special problems of mountain areas
surely the general structures that are provided should be able to handle this
yet these environments are unique with rich biological diversity
in this connection when we review what is sent to us by the commission small intimate details are revealed
in my view the european parliament does not need to make resources available to promote cooperation
you know better than i do that it is for the commission to decide to invoke rule 37
i am also astonished that this speech does not appear in the so-called ' verbatim ' report given that the verbatim report should be the complete version of events
we should know in advance what matters are to be discussed so that we can table any necessary amendments
it must be well understood that this is not a blank cheque
we know for example that many czech romanies have sought asylum in the united kingdom and canada
however though i do not want to pour cold water on anything i recall the words of jacques delors after the rio conference some years ago
the principles of ' good manufacturing practice ' and ' good laboratory practice ' could be adopted
that was to add primary products to the products which would be subject to this directive
as president of friends of music i have been very supportive and worked with nana mouskouri in the committee on this
essentially leonardo can influence the systems of provision in member states encourage transnationality and innovation enable mobility and is a program which gives us a lot of confidence in the future
we must give europe to the young people and they must take it in their grasp
these are three of the most successful programs within the european union but it is important for us to analyze who they have been successful for who have been the participants
although this basic rule is recognized by the treaty in several places for example in article 36 on the movement of goods it is constantly flouted including by the court of justice of the european communities
the effective liberalisation of the market in these products must not result in a lower standard of health protection for the population of any member state
we therefore need effective controls for goods and persons at the eu 's national frontiers
this is important because 13 billion euro banknotes will be printed by january two thousand ninety nine when they will be brought into circulation within the 11 member states encompassing a population of some 290 million people
the other subject covered in mr schmid 's report is protecting the euro from counterfeiting activity
who is to decide what is damaging and whose morals are the best
are there any comments
but this does not say much as european union policy must be implemented by the administrations of the member states
each of the member states is obliged to think about and try to resolve with quantitative goals the problem of unemployment and that seems very positive
mr president what we are mainly dealing with here is how to structure the social dialogue as it operates between the two sides of industry
i can give you some preliminary reactions to the report
the regulation could then be finally adopted in may nineteen ninety nine
i hope very much that parliament at least will do this tomorrow at the first reading on the reform of the structural funds
i am glad we have made some progress in starting down that road at the wto ministerial meeting in singapore
in order to play this role to the full the european patent system needs to be thoroughly overhauled and updated
this technical working party is modelled on the traditional-style regulatory committee
approval of the minutes
thank you mr de clercq
corsica and french hainaut will no longer be included among the regions assisted under objective 1
the current context involves a transatlantic economic partnership dealt with in a commission council agreement and more recently in fact just a week last monday in a council agreement on an action plan which we have never seen
it was meant to be a flippant remark in the spirit in which the point of order was made
here of course it omits any reference to the fact that leas are becoming a wooden horse for the overthrow of labor relations
denmark has an exemption from the third stage of emu
therefore the obstacles which impede the economic and social development of regions suffering permanent structural handicaps would be taken into consideration as a priority objective of the structural funds
we are once again faced with a good reform of the
there is a reasonable chance now that much of wales would qualify for objective i funding
well-coordinated reconstruction must be aimed primarily at improving the condition of the population
if the peace talks are to go smoothly the european parliament should not interfere
it is important to emphasise - and you are all perfectly aware of this - that the common fisheries policy currently relies almost exclusively on the structural funds
does it refer to aid for tobacco or hops to the premiums for sheep or those that are in the nineteen ninety two reform
the new situation prompted the commission to draft a report on own resources proposing as one solution the partial assumption of the burden of funding agricultural expenditure by the individual states
he is a man we all respect within the committee on agriculture and rural development and parliament
eighty per cent of the population live in towns or cities
on this second reading the commission - commissioner gradin who is here today - has accepted many of the european parliament 's amendments
so let us launch a great ratification campaign to get the court established on 1 january two thousand ninety seven
considered in the light of the kurdish issue in turkey akin birdal 's sentence actually amounts to a ban from politics
must we give lessons in morality to the entire world at any price and particularly when the draft texts contain traces of anti-russian and anti-slav racism that i find totally unacceptable
nowadays there is no longer any direct threat to the security of the european union and its member states
i do not share his views on the legal basis
this new proposal for a joint action aims at incorporating two additional elements
as the rapporteur pointed out synthetic drugs are used by five million young people and this gives us an idea of the extent of the danger
wto financial services
we shall now proceed to the vote
the commission cannot be constantly asked to take on new tasks without considering the human resources which it has to carry out these tasks
however these investigations will not necessarily lead to the discovery of irregularities or fraud and the list cannot be published without due regard
generalisations are sometimes made public which is a great disservice to the operation of uclaf
mr president madam president-in-office more and more people in europe are alarmed at finding themselves greeted on the eve of the twenty-first century by the face of the nineteenth century
similarly latvia has made huge progress in particular in relation to the referendum on citizenship
to conclude we welcome the fact along with the rapporteur that the road is now open for slovakia to join the vanguard of countries applying to join the european union
we are conscious of turkey 's central geopolitical position and the role which it can play in creating the conditions for peace in a particularly sensitive region
one aspect of this new profile is that members would be paid by the european parliament itself
i do not agree
the euro will provide europe with true monetary existence
for a long time the so-called emerging economies had been burying themselves up to their necks in debt
consequently i am a charge on public finances even though i am a member of the european parliament
by contrast a variable-geometry europe will provide a solid basis for extensive cooperation with turkey in areas of mutual interest
i only want to say that as a member of the european parliament i am of course free to decide how i do or do not vote
the knowledge that has been acquired through the research programs should be analyzed and made available and should also lead to new processes and products
nevertheless we might ask ourselves under what conditions non-eu partner companies should be allowed to participate and to what extent the money of europe 's citizens should be spent on partners not belonging to the union
it is always going to have to take place in parallel with the research
as for socio-economic research the commission 's aim that socio-economic aspects be identified as a key action in this horizontal program is an idea that is very much to be welcomed
first the perceived lack of democratic control in the fight against fraud
we are going to have to go into this very carefully
i thank you all
i would ask you to take that into account when you yourselves vote
therefore i will not vote in favor of this budget
it therefore has a collective responsibility towards parliament
we cannot do any more
if they do not then you cannot make up for it
in france everyone knows the situation concerning edf
for years the banks have hidden the cost to the consumer in an exchange rate margin which is difficult to quantify
such shocks exist in our member states
the invitation was sent but i shall check again
i do not know
there is now widespread agreement between the heads of state or government on the choices to be made in the fight for employment and on the clear need for a common european framework
we held the first meeting of defense ministers outside the council framework but the 15 eu defense ministers actually came together in vienna an historic first meeting
that is true but that was not your job
not that these are not useful matters but they can be dealt with in the specialist councils by the specialist ministers concerned
it would be an enormous step forward if trade policy were tied in more closely with the union 's strategy on human rights
violation of their rights in many instances leads to violent conflict as witness the tragic events we are now seeing in kosovo
at present there is no commission proposal or communication on the matter before the council
to be an eu member state we want a cyprus that has achieved a lasting political solution
that applies to cyprus as it does to all the other applicant countries
i am particularly pleased that on the occasion of this anniversary we have today been able to deal directly with human rights inside and outside the union
but naturally such standards can be created
we welcome the compromise over the so-called strategic reserves which the european parliament has reached with the council
look at what you voted on
this should be accomplished by combating starvation and poverty
let me return to the point i made at the beginning
taking drugs and doping other than for medical reasons is wrong
our conclusion is that iran is at present a dangerous country for intellectuals women and journalists
adopting a policy of rehabilitation for addicts and help to reintegrate into society would be the more logical approach
i shall listen to the debate with interest and welcome the comments of the few members who are enthusiasts for the transport of goods by inland waterways
i hope the commission 's authorities understand that this is in the best interests of clarity and openness and that they will give their backing to this effort
i would therefore ask you to rectify this
we are however at a crucial stage in preparations for accession and the importance of opening doors for candidate countries to participate in the community programs as well as encouraging them to adopt community regulations is paramount
for that reason i should like to thank the rapporteur for referring in very friendly and diplomatic terms to the international competition in that part of the world
hungary 's inclusion in the media ii program will provide an important incentive for hungary 's further alignment with community laws in the audiovisual sector
the first is that a significant number of the objectives set out have been achieved and i would like to highlight two of them here today the liberalisation of gas supply and the protection of technological inventions
we want more europe
but the eu must also develop its own capabilities for military crisis management in cases where the eu sees a need for action in which its north american partners do not wish to become involved
agenda two thousand ninety six is one of these
mr president-in-office it most certainly has fallen to the german presidency to steer us through a particularly demanding period
the court of auditors ' opinion on agenda two thousand ninety seven from december no 10 98 is now available and is even more skeptical
let me say first of all that i and my group can also congratulate you warmly on your statement
maastricht changed all that
this excellent report also offers further significant recommendations
the present proposal is to adjust the rules for the implementation of the community 's competition policy for estonia
this has even led to an exchange of notes among these countries
you know that it is our duty in the union to ensure a response when the situation is unacceptable
mr president i am happy to reply to mr crowley 's supplementary
according to the motion for a resolution these partnerships have to meet certain conditions
as a matter of course therefore all countries should to a large extent apply the same rules practices which distort competition should be eliminated and the efficiency of our ports should be increased
mr wijsenbeek could also be answered in writing without us hearing his question
these include more public information and an alert threshold for oxides of nitrogen as well as the one proposed for sulphur dioxide
i cannot therefore endorse the amendments which upset the delicate balance we wish to achieve with the additional quotas
first of all evidence should be provided that special treatment for maize is still economically justified when as it is the commission is proposing that a distinction should be drawn between irrigated and non-irrigated crops
lastly i would like to make a brief comment on the financial aspects of agenda two thousand ninety two
production should also be targeted at this market and competition on quality should prevail
it doubtless needs amending but with what aim in mind
the second general comment is that although the commission wishes to increase the competitiveness of european agriculture it is essentially doing so through pricing instruments and by reducing guaranteed prices
yes we should encourage more extensive livestock rearing by adjusting the way premia are paid
without this there can be no european model of agriculture and no fair response from the cap to the various european agricultural systems which are patently very different
we must put a ceiling on the aid to larger cereal farms
if we agree part-national financing the required spending must be mandatory
following enlargement towards the east the emphasis is increasingly on liberalisation which our farmers know but in my view the solutions that must now be negotiated under agenda two thousand ninety nine are only an intermediate stage
i assure you that we will implement this quickly in accordance with your wishes and that we will monitor observance of the demarcation very strictly
the main problem is really that some of the elements of our proposal cannot be readily introduced in all member states
the effective operation of the european judicial network and the mechanism set up by the council for mutual assessment will also be priority issues for the presidency
i think most of the amendments were agreed in the end so that we have reason to be satisfied even if it is somewhat after the event
of course parliament will be involved in the whole process
on the other hand we naturally have great respect for national values and cultures
if you did not act for fear of the left-wing majority in the council then i have little sympathy
if that had been done mr bangemann would not be able to say that our concern is unfounded
it is a perfectly reasonable suggestion to have a written report before us so that we do not have to rely on an oral report
at the meeting of the council held on 3 and 4 december agreement was reached on the future composition of the management board
instead he ought to sack the people who do not give the elected representatives what they ask for
there was no punishment in this case either
from what we understand the united states has a greater presence
this is a direct attack on the whole of society
the paths to peace are those expressed in the mandate from the people
the first is to ask the guerrillas to free all civilian hostages and here i would like to thank them for having freed the european development assistant camino villanueva
the fact that there are certain groups which also have rights is unfortunately being ignored
nuclear safety must improve in these countries to comply with international regulations and defective nuclear power stations must be taken out of use
one month ago we were wondering what impact the economic instability resulting from the crises in the asian and latin american markets would have
larger mesh sizes and wider introduction of the square mesh cod end and other selected gears which allow undersized fish and non-target species to escape clearly have a key role to play
i should like to describe some of the main features
in fact this is the principle of subsidiarity in practice
mr president the commission is right to have given priority to developing a european policy on the defense industry
the question arises what kind of benchmarks
the question of a flight tax or a kerosene tax which we have discussed once or twice is somewhat more difficult
i am pleased that progress has been made at long last and at the end of the day it is almost satisfying if not entirely so that we have all received our dues
we are calling into question the superiority of european law because we are submitting to the law of geneva and the world trade organization
amongst other things there are price-monitoring and prepayment systems particularly in the field of mobile telephony
i found it difficult to follow the commissioner 's interesting remarks because the background noise level had risen very perceptibly in this chamber where sound carries over considerable distances as a result of individual conversations
in my opinion the second avenue of strengthening growth potential and improving basic conditions also requires special support
these are improvements to the commission proposal
it goes without saying that countries and regions should share their resources in terms of information and capabilities
titley report a4-0482 98
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on 28 january nineteen ninety nine
nevertheless it will remain very difficult to monitor greenhouse gases where a staggering number of factors are involved in determining emissions and concentrations
it is therefore a good start on the concrete implementation of the acidification strategy
the difference between mr cox 's proposal and ours is that over five years his proposal would increase energy taxation by some 10 while ours would not increase it any more than 20
at the moment it is minus thirty in helsinki and more than forty degrees below zero in the north
furthermore i do not need to remind the house that this is an issue that requires unanimity
the european banking federation accepts a minimum rate of a 10 withholding tax but rejects the regime of information
in the motion for a resolution we have
if i have a criticism of the legal affairs committee 's opinion it is that it is too one-sided
in that way we shall be able genuinely to protect the future of the information society of music and of consumers
that would mean that coca-cola could buy the bordeaux name and then resell the cheapest wines in the world under that name
something must be done about it
by his very presence at that meeting and by what he said there he endorsed the legality of the costs of transition to competition in spain
they will therefore continue to operate independently in accordance with the structure of the national systems
thank you mrs bjerregaard
first the 1 increase in new planting rights is too low to develop the european union 's vine and wine-growing potential
nevertheless i agree with the rapporteur that the procedure for granting visas should comply with the same requirements and procedures in all the members states
i would like a reassurance that this change with regard to parliament 's press service will not lead to a situation where citizens are deprived of information on the work of parliament
as far as the institutions are concerned the report calls for parliament 's monitoring and codecision roles to be reinforced in all areas of emu
mr barros moura is to be congratulated for highlighting those political consequences
if this means that it no longer deals with foreign affairs then so be it
they would obviously be run with the help of top independent experts and would allow the debate on european economic policy to be extended
there has been insufficient preparation for and discussion of this issue yet it is a very serious matter
i would further argue for a strict rather than a relaxed admission policy so as to protect the rights of third country nationals by outlining clearly the necessary criteria for admission
but for the record we should not forget to point out that it should be for the member states themselves to decide on immigration and refugee policy
too often i hear that half of the european budget goes to 3 of the population and so on
we understand the farmers ' concerns
we agree with that
these measures follow on from the initial steps taken by the clinton administration in march nineteen ninety eight
i am sure the president 's heart is in the right place when it comes to promoting rural tourism
if they do not make a start there if we germans do not continue setting high standards our colleagues in the netherlands will soon be drowning in dirty polluted water
in spite of the ospar convention this quasi-common position proposes that nothing nothing at all should be done
we consider it most important for the wto rules to be observed
we have requested a panel which will in due course be set up
at that time israel with the status of an associated state was allowed to take part in all non-nuclear programs under the fourth framework program for research and technological development
the liberal group is therefore very much in favor of continuing scientific and technological cooperation with israel
applause
so i intend to take the vote
at present given that there are no alternative materials it is neither meaningful nor realistic to seek a ban on the use of pvc in motor vehicle construction
the state of israel has laws which result in the persecution of and discrimination against its palestinian neighbors
corruption must be stamped out and organised crime combated
madam president this is indeed a very important report
we must urge the kurdish workers ' party not to spearhead more violence nor to resort to the shows of force which have endangered their leader 's position
for the rest i agree with him that at the moment turkey is not cooperating in the implementation of programs at all let alone wholeheartedly
for this reason the members of our group are to vote freely and according to their consciences on this report
so i think we must not cut the funding but must jointly do all we can to offer the young people of europe the kind of opportunities we would all wish them to have
the fight is about preserving the resources they have and protecting the regions they live in
indeed according to the replies to the questionnaires sent out by the commission concerning the review of the common fisheries policy the sector itself does not support the need for regionalisation the only exception being the united kingdom
the americans the japanese the canadians and many other peoples in this world would rub their eyes in disbelief to see the german association of the chemical industry citing legal uncertainty
we do feel however that the three-year period for implementation proposed by the commission is too short given the need to produce a sophisticated classification system and we are therefore requesting an extension of that period
the labeling provisions for all other products should be laid down in accordance with the procedure set out in article 189b of the treaty
in some countries - my own included - several thousand experts have been appointed to go round and help the small business community to identify whether a small business will be affected
it is important that the eu and the european parliament pursue an active and progressive policy in this area
bazin recommendation for second reading a4-0033 99
but as i do not have the exact details of the article i cannot tell you whether or not it is correct
last year for example we set up a network to combat the spread of aids among women in the mediterranean countries
the message of this progress report and also of this house must be twofold
the main reason according to mrs eriksson the rapporteur is the lack of awareness of the decision-makers and this is a view that the group of the european people 's party naturally shares
madam president first i have to present my own modest part in this overall report
katiforis report a4-0090 99
mr president for some twenty years now there has been research into the effects on health of electromagnetic fields produced by low-frequency electronic equipment and the electrical power network
let me at this point appeal to our american colleagues in the congress and the senate
fiercer world competition is forcing the protagonists to take a clear and tough position
the question is whether in nineteen ninety nine we should still have the same amount of finance in the community budget for an agricultural policy which is in need of review
in future the commission will continue to avail itself of every opportunity to put a stop to the smuggling of human beings
however the authorities are responsible for this
let me comment on the amendments to the common position that are offered by the report that we are considering tonight
amongst other things there is a need for a division in all the member states between those who are responsible for the tracks and those who run trains on them
this is the direction in which things are going today
in particular the question of fairness of contributions to the community budget was raised
however the council disregarded this proposal and focused the debate on reducing expenditure
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
at this stage i can only extend to you the offer of this close and trusting cooperation
the sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m.and resumed at 12 noon
mr president the amsterdam treaty sets new standards for health policy in europe
much has been done in this regard but it is unfair to ignore the fact that any action carried out in that region is hampered by security measures and other constraints which defy economic reason
mr president on the subject of using nuclear energy to produce electricity in recent years we have had two camps the enthusiastic supporters and the resolute opponents
it will be resumed this evening at 9 p.m.
meanwhile i can inform the honorable members that the council received a commission communication on this issue on 19 february nineteen ninety nine
here our analysis is entirely in line with yours
ladies and gentlemen exactly one and a half hours after the start of questions to the council that concludes question time
i have not invented anything new
the commission also agrees with mr stockmann regarding the regular evaluation of the member states ' plans for energy savings
but these three sets of guidelines are formed predetermined and limited by the basic principles that gave rise to the process of european integration
this stifles economic and business growth and opportunity
we all know that the problem of unemployment which is the main problem in the european economy cannot be solved by using ad hoc and purely short-term anticyclical measures what we need is a very far-reaching structural approach
we can debate whether or not this represents the build-up to a recession or if it is simply a slowing down of the economy but the figures are certainly worrying
so what does the commission say on this subject
as for the rest of course our differences are political
central asia may be far away but its future will affect us all
the geostrategic situation of uzbekistan which shares a border with afghanistan and the fear that the islamic fundamentalism of the taliban will spread finally convinced me to adopt this position
political dissent is a right it can never be interpreted and judged as a crime of sedition or as a crime against national security
the next item is the joint debate on the following six motions for resolutions
the debate is closed
these two amendments refer to games and toys and it is a shame that the visitors who were here earlier have left because this affects them directly
in the end it may not help our own seafarers which must be our fundamental objective
it is remarkable how stable india has remained in the midst of asia 's economic crisis thanks to its economic strength and innovative capacity
it is a moral as well as financial imperative to ensure that this macro-financial assistance is targeted as effectively as possible to achieve these aims in partnership with the imf and the world bank
i just have one question regarding amendment no 11 to article 5 1 new does this also refer to informing the european parliament before the second tranche of financial assistance is released
in the end and always at that stage they proved too little and too late
if this crisis heralds the birth of truly european public opinion and helps to strengthen transparency it will have served as a step in the right direction - a step towards making the european union more democratic
successive treaties have increased its legislative powers and on this occasion parliament has clearly asserted its role as a monitoring body
i described her as the most confused woman in europe and still believe that is the best description of her
i entirely agree with mr jarzembowski that it is essential that north korean military activity must not present a threat
for the countries of central and eastern europe there is of course the phare program but cyprus and malta with which we hope negotiations will begin shortly are not covered
that is to say no law was proposed to implement what we decided at the time
we are now moving towards the brink of an explosive situation with unforeseeable repercussions not just in yugoslavia and the balkans
we therefore want many of the taos to be dismantled but not all of them just those which are not operating correctly
there are big questions to be decided but i will only comment on one of these which we have already mentioned a few times
in my opinion he is a really first-rate commissioner with whom it has always been a pleasure to work in an atmosphere of warmth and great personal trust
for this reason one of the strategies prior to membership should be to focus to a greater degree than is currently the case on training the police and customs authorities in the former communist bloc
mrs cresson omitted to inform the president of the commission or the european parliament of them
we will not be able to say that
this is why i particularly support the idea of introducing a parliamentary dimension into the united nations system
thursday
the european union in line with the commitment entered into in the amsterdam treaty must become an area of freedom security and justice where citizens enjoy a high level of safety
however as was mentioned earlier we are aware of the dramatic problems that the illegal trafficking of persons generates in europe
and here i am not talking about political refugees
the refugee crisis which we are now witnessing in kosovo is merely the latest tragic example
i wholeheartedly agree with that
however with it we must guarantee a level playing field in terms of competition
he has always defended production and naturally does not always submit to the limitations imposed by financial policy
i am therefore critical of the proposal to arrange our own trade visits
after your investiture by parliament in may you will in the parlance of the house be the formateur the co-formateur of the new commission
according to the rapporteur the combating of crime should be addressed at eu level and europol should be given operational powers
this is particularly important since the council 's strategy is still heavily marked by repression and a reluctance to accept responsibility
as is apparent from the nassauer report which we have just discussed this house wants to take europol and make it into an example of a supranational administration
it was a total misconception it was done in a hurry without thinking about the future of agriculture
amongst other things this directive seeks to ensure that this is the case by setting minimum standards - minimum standards for information and consultation not for participation in decision making
so thank you very much mr chanterie and mr mcmahon
there is complete agreement between the rapporteur and the commission on the objectives to be achieved
i cannot therefore accept this part of amendment no 9
most of these amendments are also identical to those tabled by mr galeote
the necessary investment for cement kiln fume cleaning can be funded by the large profit generated by taking in hazardous waste and savings on fuel costs
proceedings are also under way on irregularities in the implementation of existing directives on incinerators
life has been extremely successful because it is one of the community programs which give rise to many projects
rare diseases
these are important values but no state in europe may take national sovereignty and territorial integrity as a licence to oppress displace or commit genocide
i would like to thank president santer despite all the difficulties we have had for what he has done in the past couple of years
we now see that the community 's main interest won through
the harsh reality of the mathematical exercises in berlin gives the lie to the fine words spoken there
madam president chancellor mr santer i must say that we are delighted to see you once again mr santer
he wanted to purify kosovo so that the serbs could regain it and that is the current situation
nelson mandela negotiated for years
furthermore it is better to purchase supplies on the spot hence money is better than food parcels
question no 9 by roberto speciale h-0236 99
in short i am not voicing these concerns in order to stress them unduly
i have seen in the english and french texts that the reference is clearly to ' internal affairs '
so i would agree with that particular section of amendment no 1
i am certainly in favor of enlargement to include these new countries
if someone pollutes my land then i must have an incontrovertible right to claim compensation of some kind from the polluter
we also hope for better times in this respect
applause
unfortunately a number of colleagues have intervened to prevent the adoption of this reasonable motion
i simply want to say that one of the main aims of the union is to promote economic and social progress by strengthening economic and social cohesion among other policies
the debate is closed
how can europe claim to champion the free movement of goods when the axle weights of lorries are different in the netherlands belgium and france
mr president it is good to see indonesia and east timor on the agenda
the right of petition is therefore one way to make our fellow citizens more firmly and deeply attached to the construction of europe
it is surely ironic that our two rapporteurs have fallen victim to that very tendency and have not been selected as candidates in the forthcoming elections
the situation has deteriorated with the blair house agreement which sets a quota for the production of oleaginous protein crops in europe and it could become even worse during the 2000-2006 period
community rules must not be applied unthinkingly across the board as though the european union were synonymous with uniformity
it is primarily a legal and economic issue now and not a public health one
when these discussions are concluded we will be better able to judge the parameters for an acceptable solution
some member states have already put forward little lists of demands the netherlands amongst them
in nineteen ninety four as group chairman i took the initiative in favor of changing the modus vivendi between the commission and the european parliament
this i assure you does not detract from - indeed it enhances - the importance of the social dialogue it becomes all the more important to look after those who are marginalised the poorest members of society
the only brake on this process may be their determined struggle for a different policy underpinned by the objective of full and steady employment which will increase rather than reduce their rights
in view of the humanitarian disaster triggered by milosevic and his inhumane policies both are needed
i believe there is no alternative to the military intervention and i say this because i know how terrible it is
those ultimately responsible can no longer be negotiated with
women are falling victim to war criminals because they are women and the eu must recognize this as grounds for asylum
milosevic is responsible for this war which i hope will be the last round of violence
i agree with some of the rapporteur 's criticisms
the text presented here by the liberals as an amendment is in my view already inadmissible because it changes the whole text and therefore contravenes rule 125 of the rules of procedure
mr president i would like to say to both the rapporteur and the council of ministers settle your differences now and stop being so self-important
as parliamentarians we are particularly aware that political subject matter is only as good as the scope for communicating it through the process of public debate
in the interests of consumer protection and legal soundness i think it is necessary to have a general right of withdrawal
we regard that as both unnecessary and unacceptable as the limit values enshrined in this directive would only just have been transposed by the member states at that point
in spite of the exceptions which still exist the duration of the union 's legislative procedures is quite reasonable generally speaking particularly if we compare it to national procedures
as regards the statute for members i want to make it very clear that this is an ambition of parliament and is in no way a discipline imposed by the council as some people claim
we urgently need it
we must also immediately embark on an active program of cooperation with russia just as germany as holder of the presidency has done to its credit
we did not call for anything revolutionary
overall i feel that the solution is satisfactory
i do not believe anyone can ever be 100 right in these complex negotiations
and as far as i can see this agreement would be of less use to us than the strict application of article 272 of the treaty
there are no funds in this package for essential policies
mr president ladies and gentlemen there has of course been a great deal of discussion about the berlin decisions in the agriculture sector over the last few weeks
by taking an active part in the election campaign algeria 's citizens showed the store they set by a free open pluralist poll as promised by the algerian authorities
how did agenda two thousand ninety six take these views into account
but that commissioner still leaves the difficulty of social security provisions for atypical workers part of the original atypical work directive
of course in addition to the objective of liberalising trade we also wanted the agreement to include guarantees for environmental protection and respect for the basic labor standards of the international labor organization
the commission was keen to ensure that it was clear when a contract was completed with a third click
about a third of the community budget is spent on structural support measures
the fact that urban is to be included once again amongst the community initiatives is a victory for all european citizens
the reform of the cap was necessary but not in the form proposed in agenda two thousand ninety nine by the european commission
it therefore makes good sense for us to table this sort of resolution at the present time
in the morning before i arrived at the prison and death row i gave a press conference
a few weeks ago in front of the parliament building in brussels a woman was murdered
the sole activity of the oau if not its sole raison d 'tre seems to be to defend the old colonial borders against everything against everyone and even against obvious facts
the effects of insolvency proceedings opened in one member state upon goods and people situated in another member state depend on national legislation and on bilateral agreements between the member states
at present the commission is in the process of establishing together with the industry the facts regarding import flows and prices
mr president i should like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to address the house
we must now make a decisive contribution to the reform of the institutions of the union to building an authentic european democracy
it is to a great extent thanks to their diplomacy and moral authority that the treaties of maastricht and amsterdam introduced the new powers for parliament which we today are able to implement
despite some substantial advances we all know that the amsterdam treaty has not achieved all the objectives attributed to it at the outset the main one being the institutional reform an essential precondition for enlargement
beyond the confines of the european union the international influence of our parliament is considerable particularly in all of the countries which have applied for accession and in those which have signed co-operation agreements with the union
wrong
parliament decided to hold an electronic vote
it goes without saying that we are impatiently awaiting the second report of the wise men which is constantly being promised us and your reaction to its contents before expressing a definitive opinion
we must expect the tampere council meeting which will focus inter alia on questions relating to asylum-seekers and refugees as well as the fight against organised crime to provide concrete proposals for action to improve internal security
it was also agreed that both parts of the budgetary authorities will deal with this proposal in one reading
a regional stability pact could be one solution or a pan balkans bureau for reconstruction
that will not be a simple task
mr president madam president-in-office of the council as rapporteur for the rules governing members of parliament i would like to make a couple of observations
hence the need for this presidency to pay particular attention also to the preparation of the next millennium round
we have crucial decisions to make in the union and in the regulation of information technology over the next five years
for example there will be clear rules for new members regarding what sort of posts would be appropriate for them to take up on departure from the commission
i see it was shared in other parts of the house
mr president given the history of the united kingdom in relation to the bse crisis some delegates may consider that the uk is disqualified from giving an objective view
i can see at least three
this has been evident in the lack of progress in the fight against the predominant problem in europe the lack of jobs and the inadequate employment situation
recently the kosovo conflict has overshadowed everything but nothing can be concealed for long
the tribunal there found in our favor
i therefore appeal for attention to the facts
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday 23 july nineteen ninety nine
perhaps we were not able to explain it perhaps we could not do it perhaps we lacked courage but something was started with the outgoing commission
we must take appropriate steps as a result of the mistakes and inappropriate behavior of certain commissioners
individual accountability to the commissioners must be the first priority
given the chance by the vote of this parliament we will show that not in our words but in our deeds
madam president might i also make a suggestion as regards the events referred to by mr kinnock which are to take place in february
there has certainly never been transparency in the policies of recruitment promotion or mobility
i think though that the problem goes far beyond that
they will work to the benefit of the whole of the union
but think carefully
this is a step in the right direction
payments total 87.9 billion which is an increase of eur 2.3 billion or 2.8 in comparison to the budget for nineteen ninety nine
has europe brought us greater economic growth an improved standard of living in daily life or the expectation of participating in a great adventure
i think the problem is rather that many are not the friends of freedom and the law to the same extent
the european union must pay very special attention to the south as well as to the countries adjacent to russia
mr president do tell us which lift you were trapped in
firstly the nineteen ninety nine budget was defined at the time as a bridge towards the new financial requirements that is towards the financing of agenda two thousand ninety nine
initially the commission took this line as well but came to abandon it under pressure from the committee on budgets even though there is a great deal of scope for making economies within category 4
situation in east timor continued
what else can be done
we must do this so that the international community understands once and for all that indonesia is not part of the solution in east timor
this is the first sitting of this parliamentary legislature in which we will have question time in this case to the council
when it comes to combating organised crime what is needed is a greater degree of organised cross-border co-operation
i am saying all this because my question has been written incorrectly
it is necessary i think to show some imagination
mr president the country holding the presidency has been alarmed to see the exodus on the part of many serbs and romanies also from kosovo
i would therefore like to see us think carefully about autonomous decision-making bodies in pristina which would give the population the power to decide in conjunction with us what needs to be done
votes
capital outflow is now about usd 25 billion a year and yet foreign investment is less than usd 3 billion and falling
this parliament saw to it that the committee of enquiry was set up
mr president mr president of the commission we are agreed that the eu should no longer be synonymous with rubbish and poison being found in foodstuffs
really we ought to have had these regulations a long time ago
i feel that this parliament behaved in a eunuch-like way yesterday in refusing to link this debate on food safety and the wto with a resolution
it is clear that our food contains dioxins that also derive from external sources
the altener program is a step in the right direction
they use more energy than industry and they use it in a profligate way
mr president europe was as lavish with its fine words when apartheid was abolished as it proved to be miserly when it came to economic concessions
mr president of the commission a sorry story of child abuse in a commission nursery has appeared in the spanish press
i agree with you mr bautista ojeda top sportsmen and women who are not clean who use substances from outside sport in order to win do set a bad example
i also know that you consider television to be the most effective medium for reaching a wider audience
one in every four inhabitants lost relatives and their homes
do we want turkey to become firmly anchored in the democratic system of western values or not
we have a perfect illustration of this today with the decision of the commission to lift the embargo on british beef and the refusal by france and germany to apply this decision
as an important exporter of food the union believes it is also important to improve access to markets and remove trade barriers in this new round
i can see the instability of the financial markets
the president cut the speaker off
i will not go on given the short time allotted to me
but we would like to know whether you can tell us how the americans have reacted to the european position in favor of extending the peace clause beyond two thousand ninety four
i have already said this on many occasions
my priorities for the wto negotiations are firstly electronic commerce the area with the greatest potential growth rate and in which europe is actually very competitive
according to the rio declaration of nineteen ninety two it must be scientifically proven that a new product will have no damaging effects
mr president changing and influencing nature in such a way that future generations do not have the same chance to live as we have is indefensible be it from human or ecological points of view
what initiatives do you have under way
this is necessary because there is no such plan at the present time
under new article 13 introduced by the treaty of amsterdam the council is entitled to take appropriate action to combat discrimination based amongst other things on sexual orientation
within these frameworks the council can now implement measures to promote cooperation between member states
three obvious things come to mind
a wide-ranging investigation and a public explanation are required by those whose concerns have been justifiably raised by this very serious incident indeed in japan
it may be worth remembering this when we happily criticise unsafe nuclear energy in other countries but do so less readily in the case of our own countries
i will be ashamed if we are unable to adopt this unanimously
equally security standards must be provided and improved so as to protect the interests of consumers at all times
therefore the second amendment tackles this whole question of the ill-fitting caps and sometimes no caps at all
moreover delors ' white paper stressed this crucial issue and highlighted the very specific commitment to reducing the number of road accidents within a few years especially the more serious ones
amendment no 4 is basically a tidying-up operation as the earlier paragraph was out of date
will you find an appropriate way to report back to parliament on the responses given
we are waiting to formalise in writing and give concrete expression to the agreement which is in the pipeline between commission and parliament in order to guarantee better budgetary use of the appropriations under this sub-section
it is noteworthy that the direct financing needs of the kosovo area are considered to be mainly covered
my committee has proposed 100 restoration of these three budget lines to the level of the provisional draft budget
we should do all in our power to resolve this
it is true that some suffer from underspend
this is also the background to why so much money has been placed in reserve
the sitting was suspended at 4.30 p.m.and resumed at 5.20 p.m.
i would be pleased to hear what you intend to do about this
there is not therefore any weighting of votes such as there is in the council of ministers since it has been determined that these are people who have to vote here as individuals
without the euro some more vulnerable member states would probably have experienced monetary difficulties along with who knows some cases of competitive devaluation
the council took a positive step in this direction at tampere
in saint-denis in the parisian region six of them started a hunger strike more than 30 days ago
above all i should like here to criticise the fact that now as before no specific sharing of the burden between individual countries has been arrived at
we have to really take the decisions reached there seriously and start work accordingly
loud applause
but if we fail to embrace the crucial importance of post-amsterdam treaty developments then we run the risk of rendering europe powerless
with all these measures i will no longer be stuck for advice when constituents facing legal problems abroad call me asking for help
a total of 557 members voted
we must see to it that there is a win-win situation here and that everyone benefits when products and services are offered which are bought by consumers
i hope that to borrow an unattractively appropriate phrase the fall-out from this lamentable political decision can be contained
we are supporting illegal weapons and we really have to look at this
what has happened today is deeply troubling
what they would all agree is that we must make sure that we get value for the limited amount of money that we have to spend on culture
tomorrow we shall be open to discussion with the council and with the commission but have no doubts ladies and gentlemen about dialogue between institutions do not harbor any doubts about the determination of this house
thus the old european rule is still being applied here every base act is permitted as long as it contributes to the construction of a federal europe
because we must not demand that shipowners get rid of their fishermen with all their savoir faire and we socialists will not allow the continuation of certain companies to take place at the expense of their fishermen
i believe this really is the way to make constructive progress in this certainly very difficult situation we find ourselves in with reference to the future agreement with morocco
we need to see that a fair and democratic procedure takes place in western sahara that people have the right to vote freely
in france it was under pressure from the people from consumers and of course from ecologists and greens that this agency for food safety was established
the reason being of course that there would still be national agencies that could at any time claim that there was new scientific evidence
they are let me emphasise absolutely and completely independent
mr president it is very important indeed that the council and the commission think very carefully about the meeting that is being held and the meetings that will be held in the future on the macroeconomic dialogue
they just feel that it is wrong that ports should dictate to owners of ships
it has also been touched upon by previous speakers
the grip of the central government is becoming tighter in true russian style
mr president i believe that cooperation between russian and the european union is one of the most important conditions for creating peace in the twenty-first century
i would like to encourage the commission to adopt that approach
i believe in the internal market but i am very concerned because i am convinced that the market is threatened in its very core by a lack of uniform enforcement
we represent the public and are therefore the most important institution of the european union
that is both my own view and the view of the committee
we now have slightly different proportions of majority in this new parliament
before continuing the debate i would like to make an announcement
mr president following on from mrs van lancker i would like to say a few words regarding the modernisation of the organization of labor i.e.job improvement
mr president ladies and gentlemen the review process facilitates control and we should of course exert that control to a greater extent
i hope that their names will also be listed in the agenda
and this is exactly what we are trying to avoid a lack of balance in social dialogue
it is not adequate and it is not simple logical transparent or fair
what must be paid
marriage and divorce documents as well as judgements should as a result be recognized in all countries of the european union
i am afraid that this is not a matter for its jurisdiction and moreover that this may increase the caseload of this court
this is what we did with regard to ignalina and bohunice
nevertheless can i ask you to confirm that it is quite inappropriate for members of this house - liberals or otherwise - to seek to persuade you to hear them
i am sure that by this you also mean the relevant committees to wit the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defense policy
madam president mr solana i opposed the action of the secretary-general of nato
this is the constructive message that i wished to convey to you today on behalf of my group
our cultural industries have nevertheless been seen as i said last month as an addendum to many of the serious trade issues that are going to be discussed at seattle
the eu has not finally made up its mind whether to include workers ' standards in the decision or in a separate decision at seattle
mr president the new round of trade negotiations will take place five years after the conclusion of the uruguay round
there must be rules for competition and a court to ensure that they are respected and that means by the strongest too with regard to the weakest
the wto 's shrimps-turtle judgement at least presents an attempt to argue along these lines for the shrimps look alike whether or not they have been caught in accordance with the rules concerning animal protection
to conclude i should like to support all those who have come out in favor of a courageous position in respect of the least developed countries the lldc
this is part of a tradition that i am happy to uphold
i would like this to appear accordingly in the minutes
this particularly difficult process means that the next intergovernmental conference must proceed on a two-tier basis
it is therefore necessary for the forthcoming intergovernmental conference to aim to improve those policies which lead to a more unified european policy on security and defense
i failed to notice that we had moved on from the procedural motions to the report
mr pirker i feel the best course of action in fact is to move on quickly to the report
they will bear the full responsibility if this system and a proper asylum policy for europe fail
we also have here a system against asylum abuse against illegal immigration
then we will be told that it is too late
i also oppose the demands for common military defense especially in sections 26 and 27 which require a binding timetable for a common defense and security policy which is to guarantee the eu 's external borders
i know and i can see that it is always ridiculous to cite aid figures in the face of such calamities
mr president commissioner the commission communication on the union 's action plan to combat drugs is an important and positive communication
explanations of vote - giannakou-koutsikou report
the liberalisation of the industry and the policy of privatisation that has been pursued in various countries have not resolved the existing problems
it appears that the ideal is the destruction of the community fishing fleet
the human factor is never or almost never taken into account
we are all going to get round a table to discuss listen and find out what is not working and propose solutions which respect the independence of sports federations and the subsidiarity implemented in our fifteen member states
europe is not a customs agreement it is not an area of free trade
but we must also maintain a balance
why does discrimination on account of race or ethnic origin receive preferential treatment over for example discrimination against women and homosexuals which does not feature or hardly features as an issue at all
finally i should say that this year the policy-making process has been delayed by the parliamentary election and by the special circumstances in connection with the commission 's departure
we are of course confident that we will do so
this is exactly why it is important to characterise and classify companies workstations and suchlike effectively and to divide these into areas etc
the possibility of utilising and exhausting stocks was a very important issue as has been remarked upon in this report
the committee on budgets has long been asking for this

who ought to have acted differently
these two programs will be resourced by a total of eur 3000 million for the period two thousand ninety seven to two thousand ninety seven
the commission is of the opinion that the common position established by the council is well-balanced and coherent
but there is no room at all for complacency
islam is obviously already a european tradition and so we have no fears of the european union becoming more religiously diverse
at amsterdam a common foreign and security policy was referred to
the eu has started to become a war alliance and a military alliance
what do the national parliaments intend to do
do we not need a plan for moving the schengen borders to the euphrates and tigris
the task must now be to make parliament 's democratic accountability commensurate with the new powers which the states and peoples of europe have conferred on it
as a result mr hudghton was able to put to president chirac our point of view and get an undertaking for a possible reply to a letter we sent yesterday
mr prodi himself said that we must urgently discuss values and borders
perhaps then we can go into it in greater depth
the next item is question time b5-0036 nineteen ninety nine

the original text had the figure eur 5.5 billion which has been mentioned by mrs buitenweg
mr president madam president-in-office between the first and second readings of the draft budget for the year two thousand ninety six we have added eur 3.5 billion in other words another three and a half billion in taxes

i would like to take the opportunity to raise another issue about the global competitive environment in the car industry apart from regulation
is climate change the major challenge of the next century or a good new year 's resolution without any significant value
i would suggest that europe and the commission pursue two initiatives
i can also say that from the commission 's point of view i cannot see us doing anything but support the amendments and the progressive resolution which parliament has tabled
the european members pledged to involve women actively in environmental decision making
joint motion for resolution on the third ministerial conference of the world trade organization in seattle
this is why i somewhat regret that because of the strange set-up of this debate we are having to make do without the finnish presidency
we will ask our colleagues to interrupt their confabulation which is however connected with the agenda problems which have arisen due to the adjournment of the current debate
mr president there are two kinds of immigration that which takes place legally in accordance with the rules of each country and illegal immigration
as far as we are concerned this is a policy of de facto genocide
the report meets with my full approval
the commission 's proposal to postpone compulsory labeling and registration is quite unacceptable
this is the minimum time necessary to agree such important issues
on the first day i came here when i spoke at my hearings in september i made it absolutely clear that it was my intention to be open and transparent with parliament
we must therefore take our duty seriously and fight on behalf of the electorate
on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists i would like to thank mrs keppelhoff-wiechert as rapporteur for her rapid work and we of course emphatically support her report
madam president yesterday myself and other members drew your attention to the suspension of the computer service in the members ' offices which is anticipated to last for thirteen days

i have repeatedly said that we will not oppose nor can we oppose fixed book price systems at national level
