i was in india last week meeting with partners and we all agreed that the 
best thing to do to move ahead regarding the old unrecovered cash calls 
joint interest billings was to file an arbitration proceeding and get an 
objective third party to settle the issue as you know reliance and ongc 
owe eogil approximately 7.1 and 10.3 million respectively including 
interest on non-payment the arbitration notices reflected only the 
non-payment numbers which are 5.8 and 7.3 million for ril and ongc 
respectively we finalized the drafting and dated the notices on july 29th 
and we delivered the official notice during business hours monday july 31 
2000 this was the final step in a very long effort to resolve this issue in 
other means but as i noted to the ooc after the june meetings this was the 
only solution in the end while nobody likes to file arbitration the good 
news is in the end all parties seen this as the only solution and as best as 
i can tell at least internally ongc and reliance support this decision if 
the issue gets external i don 't know how any of the parties will respond 
our goal is to keep it as low keyed as possible but this is india and i 
would expect someone to try to make a big issue out of it 
i will be in contact with john ambler today to discuss the details of the 
submittal and to prepare for any response to the media that may be 
necessary while both parties were expecting the notice it may leak into 
the media over the next few days please defer any questions or comments to 
either john ambler larry morse or myself regarding this issue until john 
advises us otherwise our comment will be as follows 
the parties ongc reliance and enron oil and gas india limited have had a 
dispute on certain cost items and together we have agreed it is best for the 
joint venture to have this dispute resolved by an independent third party 
using the guidelines as set forth in the joint operating agreement 
mike smalling in our office will coordinate this matter with john ambler and 
the appropriate staff i will be available to respond if necessary and my 
contact numbers are as follows 
office-713-853-5934 
pager 888-493-1770 
cell 713-569-4713 
home 281-320-2198 
larry please make sure our office understands that only you are to comment 
on this and any other official e p business in india and wade sanjay would 
you share this note with the appropriate people in your office so nobody is 
surprised if something comes up mike smalling john and or i will keep you

steve 
in a discussion today with mike kelly etc it was apparent that the public 
affairs team viewed the bahamas lng transaction quite cautiously given the 
recent issues power plant development has had in florida big political 
fights that are going the wrong way i was wondering if it made sense to 
bring together a meeting of all of public affairs and the deal team to 
analyze the implications of our development plans my primary worry is that 
p l under water could have severe ecological implications that are not being 
internalized into the transaction 
i would like to try and arrange a meeting to 1 ensure public affairs 
coordination and 2 understand the deal impacts better 
please advise if i 'm worrying for no good reason

today mary joyce and i met with wanda curry i realize that there is some 
concern that wanda is a litigation threat so for the purposes of soliciting 
legal advice and in anticipation of litigation i am forwarding my 
recollection of today 's meeting to you 
wanda remains very emotional about what she perceives as unfair and 
discriminatory treatment when i asked her what she meant specifically and 
did she intend those terms to have their legal meaning she said that she 
did not intend the legal meaning of those terms rather she on a 
personal level felt that the company should have treated her better she 
mentioned specifically that no one ever called to explain in detail why she 
had not been further promoted at enron or given more responsibility at enron 
that she viewed the job in sally beck 's organization as unsatisfactory 
because sally should be treated as a peer not a superior and that she 
felt as though she did not have the support of upper management of the 
company 
i described several options for her 
take the job she was offered in sally beck 's organization 
take the job in rick buy 's organization i said i would have to talk to rick 
again 
take severence under the standard package 
take severence as a business reorg but consult with enron for a period 
at first she seemed most interested in the fourth option although she wasn 't 
particularly happy about any of the alternatives but at the end of the 
discussion expressed interest in the second option 
a large part of the conversation involved discussion of wanda 's complaints 
about how she had been treated most of wanda 's concerns focussed on jobs 
she did not get or jobs she felt were taken from her reduced scope of 
control and the fact that she felt that her supervisors did not communicate 
with her sufficiently prior to or subsequent to making their decisions about 
job assignments i suggested that there were likely two sides to the story 
and that most of the problem was insufficient communication or perhaps some 
insensitivity i also pointed out that in all my conversations i heard good 
things about her performance and had no indication that anyone had treated 
her unfairly 
wanda did complain about many things but never once complained about her pay 
at enron 
mary these are my recollections from today do you have anything to add 
enjoy 
i just had to share this with you i hope you haven 't seen it already 
thought you 'd enjoy this

i think it starts off a bit too hot i would pull up some of the arguments 
you make about the need for additional supply and the importance of 
electricity to our way of life i 'd then go into a discussion of the debacle 
in the west and how they are now playing catchup with loud polluting 
diesel generators as was reported today then i 'd go into how our 
plants in florida represent a very reasonable inobtrusive solution for 
florida 
in support of of our three power plant proposals in south florida i have 
written an editorial for distribution to south florida newspapers including 
the sun sentinel and miami herald additionally we would distribute it to a 
number of small city papers including the pompano pelican deerfield times 
pompano times deerfield observer etc 
needless to say no decision has been made regarding releasing it i would 
like your input on the subject if we decide to proceed our goal would be 
placement during the first week in june leading up to the next round of 
commission hearings which are scheduled for june 6 8 and 12 
please provide comments to me at your earliest convenience if you have any

spreading the rumor i told him we had heard it from 3-4 sources he 
acknowledged that eol was not the problem said he couldn 't believe that it 
had been identified as such and said he would bring it up on his call with 
his washington team this afternoon 
i think he will put it to rest except for whatever damage has already been 
done i did promise to get some more specifics on who has told us that el

following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group 
mapping for all business units this mapping is intended to illustrate from a 
functional view point where each activity was placed at year end 2000 vp prc 
we were considering moving to a 3 peer group structure however it as agreed 
at the last prc committee meeting to stay with the current structure since 
the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most 
activities had been placed with the exception of just 2 or 3 it was agreed 
that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an 
organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 peer groups all 
functions activities within the business units should now be reflected on the 
acttached 
the actions points from this excercise are 
1 to review and agree the attached mapping 
2 consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in 
previous prc meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 
as indicated on the attachment 
3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider 
questionable or requiring further explanation 
please return your comments to david oxley by friday may 25

evolving if you set the stage with a presentation of enron strategy then 
we will discuss how a state with its agencies and auathority can play a role 
in this evolution i have set your time for 45 minutes which can include a 
short qand a period but your message can be as succint as you can make it 
and get the point across you may have to present the enron case a number of 
different ways but the governor will give you latitude to make the point

role playing by the state and the commission plan to join us for lunch if

thanks 
i spoke with donna bobbish this morning about steve 's question does the 
president have broader authority to take action during times of crisis 
donna sent me this quick write up about what she has looked into so far 
because these questions go beyond a ferc practitioner 's expertise we asked 
donna to work with a constitutional law expert at v e to determine whether 
and under what circumstances the president 's authority may be extended 
beyond the authorities discussed in the memo 
we will let you know what we learn from that further research

sarah in response to steve 's inquiry i did look into this question 
briefly when you first gave me the assignment i read an interesting law 
review article on the imposition of martial law in the united states for 
a discussion of presidential powers there is no general emergency 
authority granted the president in the u.s. constitution also the 
article discussed the famous truman steel mills case youngstown sheet 
tube co. v. sawyer 343 u.s. 579 1952 in which the supreme court declared 
unconstitutional president truman 's seizure of the steel mills during the 
korean war in that case in light of a threatened national-wide strike in 
the national steel industry president truman concerned about the national 
defense issued an executive order directing the secretary of commerce to 
take possession of most of the steel mills and keep them running the 
supreme court said that if the president had authority to take such an 
action he had to derive it either from an act of congress or the 
constitution itself since the supreme court could not find any seizure 
authority it invalidated the president 's action the supreme court also 
rejected the argument that the president had any powers that could be 
implied from the aggregate of his powers under the constitution 
based on the truman steel mills case i thought it the wiser course of 
action to look for specific authorities given to the president by statute 
which might prove useful 
i could look into this question further if you would like but we would be 
entering martial law-type legal territory where the president would be 
acting outside of specific constitutional or congressional authority which 
has been described a zone of twilight and in light of the truman steel 
mills case i don 't know how fruitful that might be 
please let me know if you would like me to do anything more thank you

that we had been hearing that el paso was blaming enrononline for problems in 
western gas markets he asked for some more specifics about who exactly was 
spreading the rumor i told him we had heard it from 3-4 sources he 
acknowledged that eol was not the problem said he couldn 't believe that it 
had been identified as such and said he would bring it up on his call with 
his washington team this afternoon 
i think he will put it to rest except for whatever damage has already been 
done i did promise to get some more specifics on who has told us that el 
paso pointed to us can anybody give some info on that

i think we need to keep the pressure on i liked the way our basic message 
20 
was evolving over the course of last week as you pointed out the japanes 
e 20 
utilities view us as just another annoying us company who is going to come 
20 
in bang its head against the wall for a few months and then leave we nee

to date reports on enron 's role in california have been limited to a repri 
nt 20 
of a sacramento bee article appearing in the denki shimbun a limited 20 
circulation publication sponsored by the japanese utilities last friday mr 
20 
ohta president of chubu electric and chairman of the federation of electri 
c 20 
power companies made some uninformed comments at a regular energy press cl 
ub 20 
briefing about enron 's commitment to its californian customers ohta will 
be 20 
retiring from both positions in two weeks 20 
in the past both chubu electric and the federation of electric power 20 
companies have distanced themselves from mr ohta 's public comments which ar 
e 20 
generally considered to be ultra conservative and unsupported by facts as 
a 20 
result we have tended to ignore his comments however on this occasion i 
20 
think we need to set the record straight on enron 's role in california i 
20 
would welcome your thoughts on whether we should let the comments pass or 
20 
respond 
over the past few months we have received various statements from houston 
20 
for both internal and external consumption explaining enron 's role in 20 
california most recently may 10 we received from peggy mahoney via vanc 
e 20 
an ees statement dated 1 february entitled media statement about ees 20 
resourcing california customers it would be helpful if there is a 20 
comprehensive statement that has recently been put together that we could 
20 
distribute here if not we can put something together here tomorrow and 20 
email it across to you for approval with the aim of getting something out 
20

enron 01 
s proposals from nikkan kogyo shinbum 
dated may 21 
this is a thorough and helpful analysis but have we considered the broader 
emergency powers the president might have i.e. beyond the clean air act 
waivers requested by a governor it would seem that the importance of the 
defense business in california the large number of military facilities the 
public safety hazards of widespread blackouts etc. ought to trigger some 
broader authority

here 's a first draft of the emergency powers memo sarah put together with 
v e. we are still awaiting one more section on the federal reserve 's 
authority as you will note there is remarkable authority vested in the 
president including eminent domain please note page 7 which read in 
combination with footnote 4 gives wide authority to the federal government

that was created by legislative mandate last month the meeting is on may 
30th in cheyenne mr. lay told the governor that he would not be able to 
make it on that date but promised that a senior enron exectutive would be 
there i spoke with governor geringer 's staff person again this past week 
and was hoping that paul kaufman could be the senior executive but no such 
luck unless you give paul a huge new title 
in talking with maureen i understand that you have a previous conflict steve 
but i am hoping that you can review your calendar to see if you could make an 
adjustment in order to meet the request of the governor your speech would

to you at the floor meeting on april 18th for ets personnel 
if you remember i mentioned that some of our engineering people had 
transferred to ees last year and that now they all want back due to the mass 
confusion in that organization such as billings being done on excel 
spreadsheets no one being allowed to talk to other groups etc. etc 
today one of these employees linda uselman paid me a visit to inform me of 
her resignation from ees i mentioned to linda about my discussion with you 
and she said she would very much like to share with you what is going on in 
ees 
linda was one of our best employees while we hated to see her go to ees we 
thought this was for the good of enron now we see that everyone lost on 
this deal

i agree with mark 's points while we have advocated our merger with pge 
which did not concentrate market power we have intervened in opposition to 
most others moreover there is some hope that the german government will 
take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open 
access we will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger 
otherwise most mergers in this industry are defensive not procompetitive 
and in my view deserve no credit for convergence innovation or 
liberlization 
mark schroeder ect 
09 10 99 05 26 am 
margaret apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your 
speech due to press of other matters i will be brief 
first your speech caption refernecing mergers is somewhat different than 
the topic shown in the agenda i.e. industry structure and competitive 
behaviour but i trust you are wroking that out with the biee 
second in your first paragraph you note that developments in the energy 
sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years a 
point i will retrun to later but in any event not entirely consistent in 
terms of timeframes 
third i am surprised that the enron corp. view is that gas and electricity 
markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers in the past things 
like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured 
prominently in our advocacy indeed though it was not my role at enron i 
would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating 
order no. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these 
mergers concentrated market power and that such market power could only be 
mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access an 
argument we will be repeating in e.g. germany as noted below finally i 
would note that in the past i thought we had questioned the value of mergers 
as an impediment to competitive markets as i recall ken rice gave an 
infamous address speech in which he described good mergers and bad 
mergers i.e. defensive mergers like houston industries and noram i 
actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago in paris but if we 
have changed our tune that is good to know even the good mergers 
identified in his my speech e.g. enron portland have had the goods 
thwarted in part by regulators who would not let us do all we wanted to do 
that was pro-competitive also in the past we have used as a good example 
of convergence the arbitrage we have done at sithe 's facility in ny 
pointing out that we are in an energy or btu market not gas alone or 
electricity alone not clear to me that mergers in the us demonstrate this 
fourth accepting that it is the enron corp. view that mergers are symbolic 
of the convergence of gas and electricity and are what yield the many 
beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech i do of 
course agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service 
offerings innovation etc you should be aware coming over to this 
market that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed 
concerns about in comments to the regulators and will do so in the future 
here are some you should be aware of veical integration in the uk 
electricity industry not clear yet that this will result in better more 
service but definitely loss of counter-parties re-bundling of business 
before retail unbundling competition has taken hold exxon mobil 
consolidation in the upstream sector in continental europe which is already 
concentrated veba viag in germany probalby okay assuming thrid-party 
access is allowed enhanced to the wires just fyi any objections we have 
are usually communicated confidentially 
fifth if you are ging to emphasise mergers as per your title and opening 
paragraph i question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation 
which is good but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger 
activity which i read is the premise of your speech per paragraph one in 
addition recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and 
transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership but not 
clear it is all due to mergers e.g. i thin nng is just capital expansion 
nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced 
service offerings i do think excellent points can be made about the 
deregulation divestment of gathering and getting it out of federal 
regualtroy purview but that is not in the speech at this point 
sixth you describe network industries well but in the broader context of 
your speech i think your listeners will assume you are referring to the 
physical network rather than the enron vision which you capture accurately 
nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about 
convergence 
seventh in your table of converged companies you could be asked about the 
fact that duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the 
panenergy deal since sold to cms apparently keeping only the trading 
business also our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in 
nj so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the east coast 
hope this helps i will be travelling today and monday but if you have 
questions please leave me voice mails and i will return your calls 
p.s. at p 7 you describe secular change i assme that this should read 
sectoral change

hi steve 
i won 't be able to make the call on monday 
i 'd be happy to volunteer not to be on the negotiating team it sounds 
like there 's no shortage of people who want to be on the committee 
my big issue is default service this industry needs real customers and 
the only way to get real customers is to get rid of default service 
starting with big customers along the lines of the core non-core gas 
model is the best way to go the only way to sell this however is to 
get the big customers to agree it 's a good idea

the rate case that the governmental affairs group filed in january on behalf 
of transredes has come to a very successful conclusion and the new rates 
will go into effect towards the end of this month the rates are not much 
lower than what we filed for and represent a very significant increase over 
the previous rates the tariff methodology and revised regulations put into 
effect by the supreme decree were followed to the letter by the regulator 
despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down the deliverables 
here were to 1 obtain a tariff methodology via supreme decree that would 
make the company finance-able rescue it from dire financial straits and 2 
file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the 
tariff methodology this second deliverable has now been completed 
transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the 
uncertainty about rates it is my understanding that the financial market 
loved the ruling and that transredes sold 40 million worth of bonds in about 
5 minutes this ruling should also significantly increase transredes 's 
market value relative to enron 's efforts to sell its interest in the company

gentlemen 
i am delighted to report that sirese approved substantial increases in tr 's 
tariffs consistent with the law and regulation the details are 
existing tariff sirese approved increase tr clhb proposed tr clhb 
increase 
gas export including surcharges 0.18 0.2205 22.5 0.26 excluding 
rg 44.4 
liquids domestic 1.05 2.46 134.3 3.25 209.5 
liquids export 1.55 2.31 49 3.35 116.1 
clhb 's tariffs were also approved as follows 1.19 2.20 84.9 3.528 
196.5 
as you can see we did substantially better than clhb comparable with our 
liquids domestic 
we will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by sirese to reach 
their conclusions on monday but our inteligence suggests the following 
1 export gas volumes increased to 100 tr capacity and 100 gsa cuiaba 2 
assumed for sda and temin purposes 
2 rg compresion project deleted 
3 interest rate reduced to 10 or 10.5 i.e. the rate in our bond issue 
4 liquids expansion in the south reduced 
5 some continuity of service capex reduced 
6 unknown opex reduction and maybe a change to the opex allocation between 
concesions 
7 occ in service date slipped from 2003 to 2004 
8 debt equity assumption changed from 60 40 to 70 30 
our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows 
1 volumes covered by 8 rule we can blete but can expect little back 
here clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the 
short term i.e. 2002 2003 
2 rg compression not worth fighting for since we don 't even have the 
support of bg 
3 interest rate we 'll get this back when we do a tariff revision and 
actual rates are used when we get the detail we will appeal if jan feels we 
have concrete grounds i.e. commision costs etc. are omited 
4 liquids expansion in the south here we intend to do a detailed analysis 
of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquids gas production 
will be shut in if possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected 
producers pb bg vintage and chaco we will then write to those 
producers copy sirese vmeh etc stating that on their recommendation the 
project scope was reduced by sirese we will give them an estimate of the 
lost liquids gas production in both volume and cash terms resultant from 
this decision we will tell them that since they proposed these reductions 
we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal 
5 continuity of service capex we need to see the detail here we will 
take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared 
to compromise our safety and environmental standards we need to see exactly 
what has been removed but my thought is that if that means we are unable to 
provide some services e.g. lpg transportation or the continued operation of 
some liquids laterals we should write to those producers affected suggesting 
that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the 
decision again since this is capex we will get it back in the end on tariff 
revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the 
sirese budget process 
6 opex need to see the detail on monday 
7 occ will not appeal we need to do a detailed study to develop an occ 
strategy 
8 debt equity ratio strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance 
with the law regulation the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is 
40 however we have very strong grounds to appeal since a we are 
currently miles away from 60 40 let alone 70 30 b we can only borrow for 
capex as per bond issue and the policy of all most banks lending 
institutions with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover 
100 of capex we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from 
60 40 we intend to fight this one very hard using all the 
external independant help we can get 
as you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much 
needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we 
would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut this has not happened 
sirese has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases having 
got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above 
strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much 
smaller and hence managable increases 
attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above 
points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume 
assumptions i.e. the worst case

one minor point the response to the first data request implies that all 
employees went through the prc process in 2000 i am not sure this is 
accurate it 's fair to say that most did but i believe that the field 
employees who are organized into self-directed work teams do not go through 
the prc process

duke is holding a news conference at 3pm central time call in number is 
below 
duke energy offers governor davis solutions to california 's power supply 
shortfall 
committing to deliver 3,000 megawatts of new supply to california 
and a five-year fixed price supply contract 
houston and moss landing calif july 31 prnewswire duke energy 
north america dena today offered to california governor gray davis specific 
solutions to address the state 's electricity supply shortage proposing to 
deliver 3,000 megawatts of new supply through the construction of generation 
facilities in addition dena proposed a five-year fixed-price supply 
contract to incumbent utilities to address the immediate concern with volatile 
electricity prices 
california 's high electricity prices during peak-demand periods result 
from insufficient supply to meet the demand said jim donnell president and 
chief executive officer of dena in the past ten years no significant new 
power generation facilities have been built in california during the same 
period peak demand has risen more than 10,000 megawatts this combination 
has caused the state 's reserve margin to fall to less than 2 percent which 
necessarily results in higher prices and abnormal volatility 
under current procedures it takes in excess of four years to deliver new 
power generation in california to add substantial incremental generating 
capacity to california dena proposed governor davis use his existing 
authority under the california emergency services act to streamline the 
permitting process to facilitate the rapid construction of environmentally 
friendly generation by 2001 dena also asked the governor to use his current 
authority to allow california utilities to enter into bilateral contracts with 
energy providers so they could better manage their exposure to high energy 
prices 
to help solve the state 's supply shortfall dena said it remained 
committed to adding substantial generation in california within two months 
and upon receiving final regulatory approvals the company will begin 
construction on 1,000 megawatts at its moss landing facility the expansion 
of the current 1,478-megawatt facility will be in commercial operation by 
summer 2002 and with an expedited permitting process dena could deploy its 
available resources to construct an additional 500 megawatts for commercial 
operation in 2001 and 1,500 megawatts for 2002 
to address the concern associated with the high energy prices experienced 
this year dena offered to provide up to 2,000 megawatts of electricity to the 
incumbent utilities at 50 per megawatt-hour for a five-year period beginning 
sept 1 2000 this would mitigate the exposure to price spikes for a 
reasonable time period during which additional generation resources can be 
built 
dena is committed to help bring electricity price stability for the 
citizens of california through these proposals donnell said we are 
confident that our expertise in building and operating power generation 
facilities can help resolve the supply crisis

summary 
enron duke el paso and williams were on the call as was michael hoffman of 
the blackstone group the governor 's financial advisors 
on the subject of how the group would organize itself it was agreed that the 
calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate 
a smaller group consisting of duke el paso enron and williams would take 
the lead on walking the halls of sacramento meeting with policy makers and 
advocating whatever plan the group develops 
folks agreed that achieving a comprehensive solution requires a tangible 
process that is the principals need to get in a room face to face for 
however long it takes to work out a resolution 
it was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of 
next week and that it should take place in sacramento 
it was decided that the legislature and the attorney general needed to be 
brought into the process as soon as possible i.e. next week 
there was some discussion regarding the release today of plan b. plan b is 
a plan proposed by democratic and republican legislators as an alternative to 
the mou that the governor struck with edison after that call i received a 
copy of plan b. if you 'd like a copy please send me your fax number 
folks on the call agreed to have the next supplier-only call-in meeting on 
friday 
finally michael hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ratings agency 
level presentation prepared by the end of the week the goal of the 
presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to 
issue are solidly backed by retail rates 
the agenda for tomorrow 's call with the governor 's staff 
item 1 the credit issue 
michael hoffman said that the governor 's office wants to start tomorrow 's 
meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue 
hoffman said that the governor 's folks are hoping to have completed by the 
start of tomorrow 's meeting a draft of an agreement between the california 
puc and cdwr the agreement is designed to ensure that dwr gets paid for 
power services delivered 
if the draft is ready they 'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow 
item 2 identify the components of a comprehensive solution 
it was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow 's meeting 
the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution 
enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are the 
following is a brief outline which is not intended to be definitive but a 
starting point for discussion 
utility creditworthiness 
retail rates must reflect costs 
increase supply 
streamline and otherwise reform the siting process 
decrease demand 
establish real-time pricing 
implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs 
create a real market 
remove the state from the power-buying business as soon as possible e.g. 
once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness 
approximately 3-6 months 
return the procurement role to the utilities 
reinstate direct access immediately for all customers 
within 18-24 months create a core noncore market structure for 
electricity similar to california 's market structure for natural gas 
keep the industry in the hands of the private sector 
reject proposals calling on the state to take over transmission generation 
etc 
resolve outstanding legal claims investigations etc 
resolution requires certainty and prompt payment understanding that 
discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion 
attached are the contact lists

maureen 
steve 
linda will need to talk to you she has legitimate concerns that enron 
should not be too eager to help wyden on this issue as it could be turned 
against us already the may 10th energy daily article states incorrectly 
that wyden is mulling a bill that will require energy traders to release more 
market data i have already flagged for wyden 's office that this is not the 
intent of the bill and that if it is used to attack merketers that enron 
would not support it 
linda suggested that john shelk and i meet with wyden 's office to get his 
commitment that any such amendments will be killed are you in japan 
steven j kean

05 12 2001 09 31 am 
i helped hook ken up with andrew last night they talked about 6 est will 
you get a read out thanks 
sorry for the delay i have asked the question and should have an answer in 
a day or two don 't do anything rash in the meantime 
jane m tholt ect 
05 07 2001 12 15 pm 
hi steve i know you are extremely busy but i was just wondering if you 
found out about whether the 3 year period apllies to all options or just the 
ones in that program question 2 does the 3 year time frame apply to only 
options that are vested at the time of departure or does it apply also to 
options which vest over the 3 year time frame i look forward to hearing 
from you thank you 
several employees have asked about the exercise policy on stock options 
specifically they want to know what the exercise policy is on i termination 
eg as a result of the prc process ii voluntary departure iii retirement 
or iv resignation and to what extent do the rules vary across plans i 
aesop ltip deferred bonus etc the main focus is on the length of time to 
exercise i am concerned that there may be some odd incentives in the 
structure eg are severed employees allowed more time to exercise than 
employees who just leave voluntarily ie if you want to have a full three 
years to exercise options are you better off becoming a performance issue and 
getting severed than you would be if you simply left the company 
ok 
cindy olson 
05 08 2001 11 48 am 
steve i think we have consensus on how we would like the part ttime people 
handled in the prs process for mid year okay 
cindy i chatted with elyse elizabeth labanowski never returned my calls or 
messages on the pt rh issue elyse is in favor of having the pt rh 
employees in the regular prc process with education for managers and at 
facilitator training and a statement in the ground rules to ensure that they 
are not penalized or otherwise disadvantaged by the process 
david and i discussed this option which he is in favor of it as well in the 
meantime for year end we will be ready with a system change to allow us to 
see pt rh employees on the screen segregated from the full timers- and to 
have a live chart of pt rh employees as well as the full timers we can 't do 
that for mid-year because it requires a good deal of programming but it is a 
feature we can incorporate at year end 
what do you think 
gina 
thanks for the update 
rebecca 
at a meeting yesterday at opic on trakya another of our problem projects 
dabhol was raised a representative from the white house transition team 
joined the conversation i was asked the terms under which we were prepared 
to negotiate and i told them at a minimum upon a commitment by the indian 
authorities to serious negotiations which would include full compliance with 
the terms of the contracts and progress in the reform of the mseb i made 
clear that we do not see the godbole committee as the basis for such a 
discussion 
i think the usg wants to be on record politically encouraging the indian 
govt. to engage in discussions all parties consider to be meaningful in hopes 
of working things out before it is too late even while through opic and exim 
it is supporting the move towards pnt the administration may be concerned 
that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded 
that the usg has politically taken a position on the project 
in trakya for example the usg has been quite proactive in pressing the 
turkish govt on the payments issue and even in discussing the payment 
concerns with the imf so that the payments issues for the bots two of the 
four in turkey are us sponsored are taken into account as the imf program 
moves forward 
so i anticipate that the usg will shortly be meeting with the indian 
ambassador here and the us charge in delhiwill likely be directed to make the 
rounds and meet with senior government officals on the project 
i wanted you to be aware of this also any guidance you can provide would be 
helpful thanks john

you seemed troubled by the call to barton this bill may or may not be 
subsumed by the comprehensive energy bill that congress undertakes this 
summer both bills have a very difficult if not nearly impossible path 
ahead given that the democrats are in no mood for compromise the call to 
barton was to a repair relationships and with the wall street journal 
calling barton about his troubled past with enron repair is needed b 
proclaim victory even of a limited nature something i think enron has not 
done much of c build a further bond with barton so we would have more 
input at full committee something we will need given the chances that this 
will go off the track are real and d allow enron to get significant credit 
for the defeat of price caps i hear from lots of dc sources that we have 
not had any success in the house energy and commerce committee numerous 
folks at the markup noted in private conversations that this was enron 's 
first real role in the committee thus even though this is a very limited 
bill the call made sense i do not think that this means we should call the 
white house to push the bill with them the bill itself still has lots of 
obstacles and many potential threats ahead 
include on the distribution list and send out note about the monday meeting

the presentation looks fine but consider adding this idea in a few slides 
the continuation of a regulated structure poses considerable risk for 
utilities california 's utilities were pushed to the brink of or into 
bankruptcy because of a regualtory regime which allocated price risk to 
them all parties are better off in a system where the regulated enterprise 
is limited to natural monopoly functions and all other acitivities are 
conducted in a marketplace 
also did we cover the shortcomings of the japanese market sufficiently 
i think the presentation looks fine but consider adding this there is real 
risk to utilities as well as customers in continuing a regulated regime 
the california utilities have been pushed into or to the brink of bankruptcy 
fyi 
enron energy services 
rosalee 
i have left ken a voicemail request but thought i would follow up with a note 
to you that might help clarify the request 
as ken knows enron energy services recently won a stay by the 9th circuit 
court of an order by a lower court to require us to provide electricity 
service to the uc csu systems directly versus via using pg e and sce 
service the formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 
90 days from now 
we would like ken to phone charlie reed chancellor of csu and solicit 
charlie 's support for enron csu and the uc system to get back together to 
attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues 
we believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior 
executives offices will help bring the parties together 
additionally if csu and uc are interested in working out a settlement we 
would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar 
this would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus 
splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the 
appeal appearance we would like to see a delay request of one month as 
long as the setttlement discussions progress 
a desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask ken to 
have lunch with the head of uc charlie reed of csu and perhaps one 
business lead in this case this could be me i am not sure that ken 's 
schedule could accomadate that but i thought i would ask if timing is bad 
for a meeting like this we can find a different alternative 
i will follow up with a phone call to you hope this helps 
decline is ok 
i had originally declined this invitation but decided to run it by you after 
closer review he could be there if he chooses to and if you think he 
should please advise srs

sherry thanks for your guidance concerning the possibility of an enron 
participant for the vma 's seminar on electric utility restructuring 
scheduled for june 19 2001 i serve as chairman of the vma 's energy 
resources committee which will be responsible for the seminar and the 
day-long agenda it will entail 
as i explained depending upon the availability of mr. skilling or another 
key individual the vma is offering enron an opportunity to participate in 
its seminar in an important way we seek to have enron speak on the 
subject of the developing competitive market and how that market may be 
accessible and beneficial to vma 's member manufacturers which include many 
if not most of the large companies residing in virginia the purpose of 
the seminar is entirely educational as customers in virginia will be able 
under the terms of the electric utility industry restructuring act passed 
in 1999 to choose their supplier of electricity as early as january 1 
2002 and by no later than january 1 2003 the subject is becoming a high 
priority for vma members given the prominence of energy issues today 
generally and the imminence of the date when choice will be available to 
virginia customers 
we envision that enron 's message could be encouraging for vma members who 
today hear much about the dilemma in california another seminar 
participant will speak on the status of restructuring initiatives in 
california and other states and understandably wonder about the prospects 
for successful competition and effective choice in virginia enron could 
hopefully explain how market benefits might accrue to manufacturers once 
the day of choice arrives touching on enron 's online trading platform 
aggregation possibilities an alternative which the vma as an umbrella 
organization is considering and related topics 
the seminar will begin at 8 30am and conclude at 4 30pm with the possible 
enron presentation beginning immediately following lunch at 1 00pm we 
expect good attendance on the part of vma members and plan to offer 
attendance opportunities to regulatory commission personnel legislators 
and others who have been closely involved with the development of the 
virginia restructuring model as it has evolved over the past five years or 
so 
i will appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience and again 
thank you for your assistance i will be happy to discuss the particulars 
with you or anyone else should that be helpful and can be reached at 
aep 's state office in richmond at 804-698-5511

i left hartsoe a voicemail on this issue too i 'm not sure we can convince 
massey and others not to cap the secondary market for example but they need 
to understand the facts before they run off attacking the pipelines 
gas utilities in california opposed interstate capacity expansions into the 
state 
gas utilities had just as much opportunity as anyone else to participate in 
open seasons for capacity 
gas utilities fialed to fill storage 
gas utilites have failed to build adequate take away capacity at the cal 
border 
i suspect socal gas is using its interstate capacity and its in state storage 
to line its own pockets 
in short if ferc wants to get to the bottom of the problem they need to look 
in california not outside 
ray alvarez 
05 04 2001 09 02 am 
steve i 've been thinking about the intense preoccupation with gas prices 
lately and decided to pass this info along because i think it 's a red flag 
my concern is that there might not only be a backlash affecting our 
interstate pipelines but that our gas marketing efforts might be adversely 
affected it might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity i.e. 
marketers and not the pipes themselves are at fault for the large basis 
differentials between the basins and the ca delivery points whoever is 
blamed might not really matter my gut feeling is that the other shoe is 
about to drop with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the 
west this of course could affect years of effort on the gas marketing 
side in establishing competitive markets pipeline open access is of no 
avail if there is government intervention in the gas markets commissioner 
massey senator feinstein and other western senators were saying some very 
concerning things about gas prices the impacts in their states and that 
something needed to be done ferc responded with an announcement of their 
technical conference on interstate pipeline capacity and intrastate take 
away capacity which by the way doesn 't appear to address storage 
everyone wants an explanation as to why the basis differential is much higher 
than in other states since they thought it should only consist of transport 
costs ray 
ray alvarez 
05 03 2001 06 54 pm 
i was at the senate hearing today on ferc 's market monitoring and mitigation 
order and i would add only a few additional and interesting 
regulatory-related details to john 's fine summary 
the hearing was contentious- among the senators themselves among the ferc 
commissioners themselves and the interchanges between them 
gas prices were controversial commissioner massey kicked off the discussion 
on this issue citing a transport basis differential into ca of 10 when it 
was less than a dollar in other areas he then noted that the high gas cost 
would adversely affect the power price under the auction and that ferc must 
act regarding the high transport differentials- we will never get a handle 
on electric prices unless we get a handle on gas prices that opened the 
floodgates of discussion culminating with the announcement by commissioner 
breathitt of ferc 's technical conference notice of which issued today on 
the topic of current and projected interstate pipeline capacity and adequacy 
of infrastructure within ca she said that this would shed light on basis 
differentials and gas prices 
freudian slip chairman hebert was heard to say by various attendees that 
price mitigation in the wscc would apply at all times in contrast to the 
order which proposes mitigation only during times when reserves reach fall 
below 7 whether he mis-spoke or not remains to be seen 
regarding the issue of how often mitigation would be invoked in ca i.e. 
stages 1 2 or 3 
hebert opined most of the time 
breathitt said likely 80-85 of the time 
massey was unconvinced 
several senators railed at the commission for not doing its job and 
threatened that if the commission did not act congress would act 
if you have any questions or need additional detail please feel free to 
call ray

i attended both the house and senate energy committee hearings today house 
hearing was in the barton subcommittee energy air quality senate 
hearing was on last week 's ferc order on a soft price cap and related 
issues the house witnesses were dominated by california officials cal 
energy commission cal air resources board chairman of gov davis generation 
implementation task force in addition there were witnesses from the 
western area power admin and bonneville pa the senate witnesses were the 
three ferc commissioners 
highlights 
chairman barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the barton 
bill h.r. 1647 next week many on and off the subcommittee doubt this will 
happen we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will 
report back with more information and conclusions once that is done 
chairman barton also said he may go to california next week 
there was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that 
higher natural gas prices into california play in the electric power rate 
increases several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation 
costs for similar differences between california and non-ca states ferc at 
the senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical 
conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as 
it relates to california a house member from southern illinois coal country 
attacked california for using only natural gas in its new power plants 
the house witnesses primarily bpa but also the california witnesses 
attacked the negawatt provision in sec 102 of the barton bill the criticism 
was that bpa would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high 
price since it is short sell it to the dsis under contract let the dsi sell 
it at market rates and capture the difference bpa witness said that thus 
sec 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their 
strategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10 1 01 bpa 
testimony will make it tough for members of congress from that service region 
to support sec 102 
both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a 
price cap at the house hearing none of those advocating a price cap among 
the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could 
be done the witnesses just said cost plus a reasonable profit and said 
leave the details to ferc at afternoon senate hearing chairman hebert had 
the staff bring in 15 boxes from one fp l case to show how a price cap would 
take too long to bring any relief to california this summer he said last 
week 's soft price cap is much better 
also on the price cap rep. walden r-or got the cal energy comm chair to 
admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier california would not 
have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken 
recently 
the interplay among the ferc commissioners was much more contentious than it 
was a house hearing on tuesday although it could have been worse when 
senate chairman murkowski r-ak said that help is on the way in the form 
of the nominees for the two vacancies sen. dorgan d-nd made a comment that 
suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth the same concern 
came from the interplay among the senators which was also somewhat 
contentious at times 
please advise if you have any questions or would like further details

june 6,7 11,12,13 the meeting would begin at noon and last until all 
topics are covered and resolved 
please respond at your earliest convience 
thanks for the invite i would suggest jean ryall who heads our texas 
government regulatory affairs team she is certainly more familiar with the 
details of which there will be many more after this legislative session and 
the conclusion of the pilot program she is also a very good speaker and 
can probably relate a few war stories to spice things up 
steve 
i am a member of beta gamma sigma bgs the honor society for business 
programs accredited by aascb the international association for management 
education if you are not familiar with bgs a member must be in the upper 
5 of their class as a junior and the upper 10 as a senior and in graduate 
school to be nominated for induction into the society 
in an effort to provide additional programs and benefits to alumni members 
alumni chapters are being developed around the country there are currently 
nine alumni chapters around the u.s. with a new one being formed in the 
houston area i am serving on a steering committee for the development of 
this houston area alumni chapter our primary reasons for starting a houston 
area chapter include networking professional affiliations outreach to 
students resources learning opportunities and providing scholarships 
our initial outreach to beta gamma sigma members will be through a 
reception dinner to be held in october 2001 we are currently looking at 
either october 16 or 18 all 6,200 houston area members will be invited to 
participate however we expect attendance to be closer to 75-100 people 
the ages experiences and business affiliation of the members will be very 
diverse but all will have the common thread of business excellence 
the details of this event are still being finalized however at our last 
meeting the discussion encompassed possible speakers and topics 
overwhelmingly the team decided on electricity deregulation in texas and 
since i work at enron i was asked to assist in locating a dynamic speaker 
cliff baxter suggested that you would be an ideal speaker on this topic are 
you available and willing to address this group in october 
if i can provide any additional information please let me know 
thank you for your consideration steve 
do we have a mechanism to survey employees can we do a scientific poll

thanks for the call a couple of weeks ago regarding our new ad campaign the 
challenge as i understand it is that we have difficulty in quantifying the 
benefit and effectiveness of our ads we can measure on a periodic basis 
what the ceo cco cfo perception of enron is on a periodic basis but this does 
not break down the impact of our pr efforts from an ad campaign i 
understand this dilemma 
but one thing that we could measure that is quite important to me is what our 
employees think about these ads if all else fails these ads should make 
our employees proud to work for enron and this is something we should be 
able to measure on a consistent basis 
i know you have an upcoming event in california where your organisation will 
talk about problems and challenges we have so if you could consider this 
idea i would be very appreciative and of course don 't get to hooked on 
god 's country while you are in napa

williams reliant enron duke aes dynegy mirant and sempra have been 
invited to a meeting with the governor the press release provides the 
agenda will include unpaid debts credit and the supply of power 
williams is concerned about attending such a meeting of competitors without 
the presence of antitrust counsel even under the sponsorship of the governor 
who presumably acts as both the sovereign and on behalf of the buyer s 
we are looking into the sovereign immunity and noerr-pennington issues to 
determine how best to protect any such group discussions from challenge or 
as evidence in any of the pending cases are any of your clients also 
concerned about this and are you also looking into these issues 
williams would like to have a joint defense protected conference call 
perhaps later today if possible to discuss this meeting and consider 
whether antitrust counsel is needed for the group or if each participant 
should attend with its own counsel please let me have your thoughts and 
whether one of you or other counsel is interested and available to 
participate in a conference call thanks

the complaint albeit brief filed may 1 in san diego superior court by 
strategy integration inc versus michael aguirre and the other hendricks 
plaintiffs attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure a hard copy 
is being faxed the expert firm alleges they were retained to explain 
research and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the california energy market and 
retained to perform utility and energy consulting services after 
alleging that the hendricks attorneys refused to pay plaintiffs first 
billing it is alleged that defendants refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions plaintiff drew in its analysis we should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to senator dunn 's office or a more friendly 
senator without identifying us as the source .they can see what some expert 
in the field hired by the plaintiffs class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion i suspect 
that sen dunn has no interest but some republican senator might have some 
use for it it could have some value if the hearings go forward this is not 
urgent timewise but i wanted to bring it to your attention

this is an issue we have long struggled with we have conducted several

dear steve jim and rick 
i just wanted to give you a quick update on my situation at rice and to 
inquire as to a future project with your group at enron 
first i apologize for my prolonged recent absences i have had two 
long-standing academic projects one was due 4 19 it was on final review 
a paper about corporate political strategy and just was accepted for 
publication at our top academic journal and another is due 5 31 the 5 31 
paper was commissioned long ago but is a key paper in a june conference 
topic is methods to study corporate political activities and the public 
affairs function in order to get it done properly i need to forego any 
work at enron until later in the month 
a project of interest to me at enron and i hope one that you also have 
interest is assessing the effectiveness of governmental affairs john 
told me that he conducted such a study for the group last year one of the 
methodological challenges is to calculate the benefits that government 
affairs brings especially in a system where for example on the 
legislative side much of the work of government affairs is to block 
legislation at very early stages i suspect that govt. affairs needs to 
justify its existence for internal budgets at enron and thus the benefits 
of the function are important to quantify i 'd like to review any of the 
previous work and make suggestions as necessary 
at some point let me know how you would like to proceed 
otherwise i hope all is well with you all

it is critical to our nation 's energy future to achieve robust competition 
in wholesale power markets in order to ensure that electricity can move most 
effectively from where it is produced to where it is most needed to that 
end this administration will strongly encourage the federal energy 
regulatory commission ferc to actively exercise jurisdiction over all 
aspects of electricity transmission in interstate commerce and place all uses 
of the grid under the same rates terms and conditions this jurisdiction 
must also be extended by congress to cover non-ferc jurisdictional power

the forbes april 30 2001 editorial piece slow starters on page 24 discusses 
the entry tax which is the capital burden for starting a new business it 
states that rich countries 
on average have relatively low entry costs while poor countries have 
stagering entry costs caused 
by corruption endless beuacracy and cost of delays these entry hurdles 
and asscoiated costs 
do not produce any tangible benefits for consumers workers or the 
environment 
we might want to make the analogy of entry tax for new deregulated gas 
power markets things like 
negotiated third-party access rather than regulated tpa substantially slow 
the speed of new entrants and hence deter competition 
negotiated tpa creates uncertainty for new entrants they never know what 
they are going to get and clearly slows 
the new comers down 
i will send you a copy of the forbes piece 
john 
i have advised against ken or jeff attending the generators meeting ken is 
still willing to make time avail on the 3d to meet with the gov 
all--here 's some thoughts on the rga related events we currently have ken 
scheduled to participate in an energy roundtable discussion on the afternoon 
of the 2nd with at least four governors attending that session--kempthorne 
hull geringer and ridge engler and rowland are also attending the overall 
event but they will be in a healthcare breakout session kaufman and i 
thought that it would be particularly helpful for arizona gov hull and idaho 
gov kempthorne to hear ken 's remarks and have a chance to talk with him 
i have also been working with rosalee to schedule an early evening 
6 00-7 00pm meeting that night with exelon co ceo john rowe john rowe 
will be in california for some investor meetings and well as attending some 
sections of the rga events i have told my counterpart at rowe 's office that 
we would confirm ken 's availability on monday morning 
if you do decide that ken should attend the davis meeting in sacremento that 
day instead we will just reconfigure a bit paul and i will cover the rga 
events and i will cancel the john rowe get together i would also want to 
talk about having mr. lay reach out to hull and kempthorne via phone sometime 
in the near future same with rowe

i received a return call from lelanie in governor davis office this 
evening she said the governor wanted to invite ken lay and jeff skilling to 
a meeting the governor is having at 2 00 p.m. in sacramento on may 2 with a 
lot of ceos i still pressed for a one on one meeting on may 3 in 
sacramento but she told me the governor wanted to have the one meeting all 
at once and his schedule was very tight on thursday may 3 i transferred 
her to sherri and called ken ken wanted me to try to get more specific 
information which she shared that it is with generators sempra williams 
calpine duke dynegy and reliant she also said since the governor has 
worked with ken she thought he might prefer that he attend ken said to let 
you all know and be thinking whether we even want to do it he said one 
thought might be that he 'd do that meeting and maybe jeff could do the one in 
l.a. on may 2 
talk to you monday

monday mid-day and will travel with dr. lay beginning on wednesday to 
austin and then on to lax sacramento etc steve said there really isn 't 
time to have a pre-briefing so any questions that ken has will have to be 
addressed enroute to ca 
rosalee we 're giving steve the briefing book today so he can review over 
the weekend and we 'll have a final copy to ken before he departs next week

on the exercise of market power through 
strategic withholding in california 
scott harvey and william w. hogan 
april 24 2001 
executive summary 
beginning in june of 2000 the shock of unexpectedly high prices in the 20 
california electricity market convinced everyone of the need for policies t 
o 20 
correct the apparent market failures the public debate and policy 20 
discussions have been dominated by a focus on market power as a principal 
20 
problem amenable to regulatory solution however design of effective 20 
policies to moderate prices or mitigate their effects depends on the 20 
diagnosis of the underlying causes high prices attributable largely to an 
20 
exercise of market power in electric generation would point to particular 
20 
market participants and behaviors that could be targeted for regulatory 20 
action by contrast high prices attributable to bad electricity market 20 
design would indicate a need for changes in the design high prices 20 
attributable to higher fuel prices environmental constraints and capacity 
20 
shortages on the other hand would prompt actions to address the cost of 
20 
fuel and environmental limitations and indicate that retail loads should 20 
receive the appropriate price signal for conservation 
suppliers could affect market prices by strategically withholding some 20 
capacity in order to profit on the capacity actually sold in the market b 
ut 20 
charging high prices during periods of scarcity is not classified as 20 
exercising market power if there is no strategic withholding of supply 20 
likewise refusing to supply without being paid is not an exercise of marke 
t 20 
power although the potential for withholding exists for many suppliers t 
he 20 
focus of attention has been on the exercise of market power by thermal 20 
generators in california 
on its face the experience of extremely high prices suggests that the 20 
exercise of market power could be important but at the same time the data 
20 
show that there have been profound changes in the california market such th 
at 20 
the thermal generators have actually increased their production more than 
20 
demand has grown if anything thermal generators that hit annual output 
20 
limits produced too much rather than too little in the summer of 2000 20 
furthermore the widespread impacts of higher electricity prices throughout 
20 
the western market both on and off peak indicate that if the exercise of 
20 
market power is important it is occurring to an extent and through channels 
20 
unprecedented in this or other electricity markets in short this is a 20 
complicated story and there is ample room for further investigation of the 
20 
data and diagnosis of causes 
examination of the major analyses of the exercise of market power reveals 
20 
that the estimated magnitude of the possible strategic withholding of 20 
electric generation is small enough to make it important to verify the 20 
simplifying assumptions if strategic withholding were large and pervasive 
20 
then the real details of the california electricity market could be ignored 
20 
but it is by now apparent that the evidence is not clear and any finding o 
f 20 
the presence or absence of strategic withholding of generation in the 20 
california electricity market could turn on the simplifying assumptions use 
d 20 
in the analysis of the data for example annual limits on production 20 
dictate that plants should not run in many hours when prices are higher tha 
n 20 
direct incremental costs hence examinations of output decisions for 20 
individual hours or months are necessarily incomplete the variation in re 
al 20 
time conditions is large enough to produce significant reductions in output 
20 
compared to the expectations given day-ahead prices hence with capacity 
20 
constraints average optimal production is necessarily less than optimal 20 
production at average prices limits on the ramping rate of generation 20 
units start-up costs minimum load costs and other operational 20 
inflexibilities imply that a dispatch day is not just twenty-four separate 
20 
hours and must be analyzed chronologically recognizing these factors and 
20 
so on accounting for such effects can reverse the implications of the 20 
previous evidence unfortunately the real details are neither simple nor 
20 
incidental 
it is difficult to conduct a study of market power based solely on publicly 
20 
available data a fuller analysis would require data available only to the 
20 
california independent system operator and has not been done many factor 
s 20 
contributed to higher electricity prices in california and the market powe 
r 20 
theme is only at most part of the story the import of the previous 20 
analyses is not to prove that market power has been exercised in the 20 
california electricity market but rather to suggest that it might be 20 
important the import of the sensitivity analysis here is not to prove tha 
t 20 
market power has not been exercised in the electricity market but rather 
20 
to suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even b 
e 20 
significant with the available data in the public domain and the special 
20 
complications introduced by the california market design the margin of err 
or 20 
in estimating the extent of the possible exercise of market power through 
20 
strategic withholding of electric generation is of the same order of 20 
magnitude as the effect being measured on balance to date the publicly 
20 
available data provides no reason for the federal energy regulatory 20 
commission to change its conclusion that there is no evidence of strategic 
20 
withholding nor any proof that no strategic withholding has occurred 
by contrast there is general agreement that the california electricity 20 
market design is 01 seriously flawed 018 furthermore there is evidence 
that the 20 
policy responses that have been adopted in california have accelerated an 
20 
already serious market collapse hence without dismissing the possibility 
20 
of the exercise of market power the principal policy focus should be on 20 
fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in market 
20 
design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown 
separate from market power mitigation california should pay its bills rai 
se 20 
incremental prices to retail customers and move as quickly as possible to 
20 
operating a coordinated and efficient market with consistent pricing for al 
l 20 
that includes unit commitment day-ahead scheduling and real-time 20 
balancing although not a panacea these steps would address immediate 20 
problems and set the stage for longer-term initiatives to expand generation 
20 
capacity transmission infrastructure and the reach of an efficient market 
20 
to the western interconnected grid

could you coordinate with cindy stark on the meeting with massey in a couple 
of weeks stan has asked me if i would like to attend i would but don 't 
know when exactly it is scheduled for 
stanley horton 
04 26 2001 04 53 pm 
i agree i suggest the following joe we need you to go give a pitch to 
massey 's assistats about what is going on next jerry halvorsen has 
scheduled a lunch with massey in two weeks he has invited me to attend 
what do you think 
steven j kean 
04 26 2001 03 09 pm 
we need to communicate with massey before he gets completely carried away 
blaming the interstate pipeline business for gas price spikes we need to 
get him the information regarding cal ldcs failure to fill storage and their 
opposition to additional pipeline construction in the state shelley 
could you forward copies of the ldc filings to the group should joe or i 
or both try to see massey when i am in town next week 
last week i distributed a presentation that the brattle group gave before 
the california inquisition i.e. legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the cal border 
the brattle group is a consulting firm that edison has long used to beat up 
on socalgas recall that edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants edison arranged for the brattle group to be the star 
witness at the cal leg gas hearing their job was to set up el paso and 
dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day their 
message was simple and simplistic 
el paso and dynegy have market power 
they have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border to obscene levels 
that in turn has driven up electricity prices 
ken lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow and rob bradley asked that i provide 
the alternative view to the edison brattle rant in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic it 's attached apologies it 's quick and dirty 
but it provides the basics 
obviously no need for us to defend el paso or dynegy but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the california 
legislature is peddling 
finally we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing the 
california puc ferc lawyer claimed that ena and tw colluded to drive up basis 
when ena controlled a portion of the capacity but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after ep and dynegy

nice work kerry and barb i think we should do the follow up work on setting 
a follow up meeting with the senator ken left it open whether he would be 
available when the sen is in houston so we have made no commitment in that 
regard 
janine migden 
04 27 2001 08 32 am 
thanks steve 
that 's great news just as an fyi the memo that ken worked from was 
prepared by kerry stroup and barbara hueter who are the leads on missouri 
as a follow-up will sen. kinder be contacting ken lay directly or should 
kerry and barbara contact sen. kinder 's office as the date gets closer to 
make arrangements 
please advise 
thanks 
janine 
steven j kean 
04 26 2001 08 07 pm 
ken talked to sen kinder he made the points you had prepared kinder 
agreed to shelve the legislation for this session he said he had been 
hearing from several others including proctor and gamble which has a big 
facility in his district that the legislation was not going to help 
competition develop in the state he expressed willingness to work with us 
on a better package and also expressed interest in coming to enron 's 
offices he is going to be in san antonio in august and would like to come 
to houston around that time 
peggy mahoney ees 
04 27 2001 03 58 pm 
fyi 
early next week ees is filing an environmental permit for a gas fired or 
diesel 50 megawatt mobile temporary generation 
facility in gallup new mexico we anticipate that we will use gas but in 
either case we will not pass the emmissions threshold 
obviously diesel will provide less generation enron currently has a gas 
compressor on site and we own the land 
we are seeking to deliver the power to markets in the west this will serve 
the palo verde region jim steffes has been 
advising as to the local permitting processes 
i will keep you in the loop as we proceed we will probably look to permit 
other such generation facilities in the west

enclosed is revised regulatory issues memo that served as the basis for 
discussion at yesterday 's regulatory review meeting--- the only outstanding 
issue as i just communicated to charles still at skadden is confirmation 
of the fact that there are no antitrust approvals required in south korea 
relative to sk- that confirmation should be forthcoming from local counsel 
this evening lisa- i assume you will see this gets to bill gathmann 
immediately so he can forward on to regional general counsel for final 
sign-off

issues memo

i think they should try to get in to see lundquist but i don 't think we need 
to participate in this we have been focussed on nation-wide issues when we 
have had the opportunity to meet with lundquist and i don 't think we should 
use our limited shots here 
we have met an individual named wayne valis of the lobbying firm of valis 
associates he likes the approach we are taking to the problem he is 
offering to get us access to andrew lundquist i said staffer preciously but 
we now know he is chairman of the president 's energy task force he also 
thinks he can get us in to top levels of the energy department and the white 
house we think he is talking about carl rove who was g.w. s campaign 
manager and is now a senior white house counsel 
for this service he wants 10,000 plus direct expenses if unsuccessful in 
at least getting us into lundquist he will not charge anything we think 
it 's a worthwhile shot could duke and or enron agree to split the expense 
with us also it will be imperative that all of us whether paying or not 
be represented at whatever meetings are arranged 
please advise 
regards 
steve crain 
i forgot to email myself the brief to track changes but here are my changes 
in writing 
p 1 para starting focusing on the latter that sentence change get 
creative to be innavotaive in its approach 
p 2 1st full paragraph second sentence change uniting to common and 
there is a typo on line5 reduction n consumption should be of 
page 6 we need the rr for pg e. 
under part vii rate design can we insert a sentence that our proposal 
unlike the others does not arbitrarily allocate costs to peak period we 
told scott we wuold insert the arbitrariness of other proposals several times 
in the brief 
we also need ro insert discussion about relation of peak to offpeak prices 
as a 3 2 ratio which is not what other parties have proposed 
page 8 2 derivation of threshold usage first sentence delete between 
in first sentence 
page 9 second full paragraph begining again the uds 's second 
sentence sited should be cited 
p 12 first full paragraph beginning a primary component insert a 
sentence after the second sentence to mention again the arbitrariness of 
proposals allocatin costs between peak and offpeak 
second full parag beginning enron 's proposal can stick a sentence about 
arbitrariness in there too and change more necessary goal in 4th sentence 
to more critical goal 
i don 't have the email i sent out about what we agreed to insert with scott 
so if you have a chance check it to make sure we did everything we agreed to 
i am going to try to come into the office very early tomorrow and will check 
email again but my son has an appointment with the neurologist here in 
houston at 9 20 am tomorrow and that is where i will be when you have the 
9 30 call we made this appointment months ago but i will communicate with 
harry and everyone else before then thanks 
please coordinate with pge on the comments 
steve pge has 10 days to take a position and file comments on extending the 
new must offer provision west-wide does enron have a specific policy position 
on this question on the other questions we like the surcharge and hate the

the following report is comprised of what was discussed at the commission 
meeting held tonight at approximately 7 pm est and additional intelligence 
gathered from ferc staffers after the meeting by joe hartsoe 
physical withholding to prevent physical withholding the plan will 
require sellers with pga 's to offer all their available power in real time 
all california generators even those not subject to ferc price regulation 
will be required to sell into the iso 's real time market as a condition of 
their use of the iso 's interstate transmission lines hydroelectric 
facilities will be exempted 24-7 for 1yr 
price mitigation the plan will establish a single market clearing price 
auction for the real time market during stage 1 2 and 3 emergencies in the 
iso 's real time market each generator other than hydro with a 
participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power 
and bid its marginal cost based on the generator 's heat curve emission 
rates gas costs and emission costs plus 2 for o m. the gas cost will be 
the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in california 
emissions are to be based on cammon fitzgerald the gas cost and 
emissions will be published the day after for use on the following day a 
single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators 
highest bid sets the clearing price each gas fired generator must file with 
ferc and the iso on a confidential basis heat and emission rates for each 
generating unit the iso will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost 
for each generator including maintenance and operating costs in the event 
a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price the generator must 
within 7 days of the end of each month file a report with ferc and the iso 
justifying its price ferc has 60 days to review act no opportunity costs 
in real time marketers are in the same boat as they must be prepared to 
justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with 
no opportunity cost however credit sleeves are permissible 
demand response beginning june 1 only public utility load serving entities 
must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be 
curtailed under those bids ferc is attempting to break the demand curve 
24-7 
outages pga generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced 
outages in accordance with the commission staff proposal adopted by ferc 
term order expires one year from date of issuance 
rto filing california iso and two utilities must make rto filing by june 1 
or order lapses with no further effect 
iso reporting on september 14 2001 iso must file a status report on how 
things are working and how much generation has been built comments are due 
in 15 days quarterly reports thereafter 
revocation of market based rate authority and refunds the market based rate 
authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1 no physical withhold 
of capacity and 2 no inappropriate bidding behavior inappropriate bidding 
behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the 
generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit 
behavior an increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be 
inappropriate in addition hockey stick bids are expressly prohibited 
i.e. bidding 95 at marginal cost and 5 at a much higher level 
limited 206 filing applies to sales in the wscc outside california 
refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a 
control area falls below 7 control areas are not required to publish when 
this condition occurs apparently anything over marginal cost must be 
justified all marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell 
contractually and physically available capacity energy to a location within 
wscc ferc is attempting to mirror the rules applied in california 
comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations the refund effective 
date is 60 days from publication of the order 
nox limits in california must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is 
prohibited from running by law however it appears that incurring fines 
does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part 
of the price bid also if nox is limited may seek to show that generation 
would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price 
surcharge to pay past amount due comments are due in 30 days on 1 whether 
ferc should require the iso to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow 
account to pay past costs and 2 the effect this surcharge would have on the 
pg e bankruptcy filing 
no mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from 
california the order is not finally drafted as of yet and the status of 
the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the final order we will 
keep you posted 
ra 
we need to communicate with massey before he gets completely carried away 
blaming the interstate pipeline business for gas price spikes we need to 
get him the information regarding cal ldcs failure to fill storage and their 
opposition to additional pipeline construction in the state shelley 
could you forward copies of the ldc filings to the group should joe or i 
or both try to see massey when i am in town next week 
last week i distributed a presentation that the brattle group gave before 
the california inquisition i.e. legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the cal border 
the brattle group is a consulting firm that edison has long used to beat up 
on socalgas recall that edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants edison arranged for the brattle group to be the star 
witness at the cal leg gas hearing their job was to set up el paso and 
dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day their 
message was simple and simplistic 
el paso and dynegy have market power 
they have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border to obscene levels 
that in turn has driven up electricity prices 
ken lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow and rob bradley asked that i provide 
the alternative view to the edison brattle rant in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic it 's attached apologies it 's quick and dirty 
but it provides the basics 
obviously no need for us to defend el paso or dynegy but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the california 
legislature is peddling 
finally we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing the 
california puc ferc lawyer claimed that ena and tw colluded to drive up basis 
when ena controlled a portion of the capacity but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after ep and dynegy

dear mr. metts 
enron being one of the extraordinary companies that has been able to 
restructure the corporation in an effective way and that still is under 
important business transformation is a subject of many interests the 
current challenges are keeping company 's management busy being aware of 
this i wanted to take liberty of asking if it would be possible to get 
someone of enron 's top executive to contribute nokia 's top executive 
development program we have invited a few external key note speakers to 
elaborate their company 's transformation this kind of experience change has 
proved to be beneficial for both parties also nokia 's experiences have been 
valuable input in certain restructuring processes 
this program called panorama is an annual top executive development 
program which takes about half a year in three modules in every year we 
have nominated 35 participants to this intensive action the program target 
is three folded give input to company 's strategy development strengthen 
and integrate common understanding of company 's direction and develop 
leadership capacity the program owner is jorma ollila ceo of nokia 
what are benefits from enron 's point of view in the case we are able to get 
someone of enron 's executives in the program i think that one of the most 
important outcome of this kind of events is to open a dynamic networking 
and discussion forum between our executives both parties could capitalize 
this cooperation 
in short we would appreciate very much if we could have your company 's 
presentation in this panorama forum 
looking forward to hearing from you 
yours sincerely

john 
to be sent to all enron europe all employees in japan all global markets 
and all vps and up around the company 
enron has established several wholesale businesses in japan in the last year 
including metals power plant development via our investment in encom 
coal lng weather we see significant opportunities in each of these 
businesses and we will continue to expand our presence in japan in order to 
capture these opportunities however while japan continues to make progress 
towards a liberalized electricity market significant barriers to power 
trading remain under the current interim market structure until further 
tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in 
japan we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the 
significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale 
businesses any statement regarding our existing power sales commitment 
once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to 
aggressively pursue enron 's traditional position as the leading buyer and 
seller of electricity in every deregulated market 
we are making a number of organization changes in order to better align our 
resources with the opportunities in the japanese market deleted text joe 
hirl our president of enron japan will move to the global markets group and 
lead a team that will focus on developing all our global markets 
opportunities in japan especially weather oil lng coal and 
shipping we expect to continue our general recruiting of japanese 
nationals and as president of enron japan joe will continue to provide the 
overall business leadership to both recruiting and the analyst and associate 
program in japan the finance origination team headed by jeremy thirsk will 
continue to report to joe and also move to global markets our power trading 
group led by morton erik pettersen will transition into other roles around 
enron the equity fx interest rate team which is a part of global markets 
has two employees in the tokyo office today and they expect to expand their 
efforts throughout the year 
the encom group which is our power plant development business with minority 
partners and headed by carey sloan will continue its efforts in developing 
power plants in japan we are pleased with the progress we are making on a 
number of sites and encom will continue to report to the enron europe office 
of the chairman 
our metals team headed by kazunari sugimoto will continue to report through 
enron metals in london 
by may we expect enron credit to have two to three employees in tokyo pursing 
the credit derivative business these employees remain in enron credit a 
part of enron europe 
ebs has two employees headed by jim weisser and this team expects to expand 
by year end 
the industrial markets team also expects to have two employees in the tokyo 
office in the next couple of months 
in the last seven months the commercial support services for japan have been 
transitioned to london for support and this is not changing jane mcbride 
heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report to mark evans 
general counsel in london the rac function will continue to report to ted 
murphy head of rac for enron europe the risk management and accounting 
team is headed by jan-erland bekeng will continue to functionally report to 
fernley dyson in london the it hr tax and real estate teams will also 
continue to functionally report to london 
nick o 'day who heads the public affairs group government regulatory 
affairs and the public relations in japan will report to the enron europe 
office of the chair with a public relations functional reporting to jackie 
gentle in london and a government affairs functional reporting to rick 
shapiro in houston we anticipate that his team 's efforts will be primarily 
directed to supporting the encom power plant development team but they will 
also continue to provide support for global markets ebs industrial markets 
we have already made considerable progress in breaking into the japanese 
markets across a wide range of enron businesses and we anticipate that this 
will provide significant profit growth for years to come through these 
current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our 
resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company

we can create significant mutual benefit by partnering with a firm which is 
focussed on developing it systems for bulk power systems 
we need to take our deregulation model to the next level of detail by having 
it solutions which will support our view of how the market ought to work 
the it firm would benefit from our access to the policy makers domestic and 
international whose decisions will make the it firm 's systems either 
successful or obsolete 
call me if you would like to discuss 
to all--steve horn 's investment group has been approached to possibly invest 
in a company soft that makes ems and tagging systems which bpa is 
using and pge may use we met w shashi patel of steve 's group today and 
discussed that there are competitors out there including oati alstom esca 
who are partnered with ross perot ross perot has approached enron about 
promoting its system in the midwest iso we used this system for enron 
control area 's ems ross perot is going to contact steve kean to set up a 
meeting to show us his product also kevin presto thinks that oati would be 
a good investment 
steve kean--steve horn and shashi patel are interested in being included in a 
presentation by perot 
sarah and joe--can you think of any ferc regulatory constraints that would 
limit enron 's ability to invest in one of the software providers to 
utilities rtos i couldn 't think of any reason off hand 
thanks 
steve joe sarah--see the attached memo from alstom esca to kevin presto 
alstom esca did the enron control area 's ense ems system that we needed to 
comply with nerc policies how should we proceed thanks 
what are your thoughts i recommend talking with steve kean and joe hartsoe 
asap to coordinate with the esca oati perot system consortium regarding the 
midwest iso dick george from esca mentioned that ross perot would like to 
make contact at a high level inside enron to discuss the merits of enron 
supporting a for-profit transco structure for the midwest iso the 
esca oati perot system consortium is offering a system to the midwest iso 
that is designed to support a for-profit transco the consortium 's primary 
competitor abb has a system that supports the more structured iso 
environment similar to california and pjm 
kevin and lloyd 
the signatories of the midwest iso follow 
allegheny power 
ameren formerly union electric and central illinois public service company 
cilco 
cinergy 
commonwealth edison 
hoosier energy rural electric cooperative 
illinois power 
kentucky utilities 
louisville gas electric 
northern states power 
wabash valley power 
wisconsin electric 
the status of the formation is anti-profit i.e. a holding pattern is in 
place with a ferc tariff request to carry over seven years the view is 
that a for-profit-iso goes completely against the grain and that only a 
mandate by ferc will get them to change given entergy 's fight with ferc 
even a mandate will be a hard fought court exercise 
at present there are sixteen control areas therefore the system requirement 
with grandfathered contracts in each is odious 
nevertheless the form esca and our partners perot oati and tenfold offer 
is a full-up system ready for a for-profit implementation as you might 
expect the division of responsibilities on the proposal is perot as program 
manager their position with the california iso again oati for tagging and 
congestion management tenfold for settlement and billing and finally esca 
for the ems market systems we prefer a for-profit model as it betters our 
offering and provides more near-term opportunity 
discussions with the perot oati and tenfold partners concurred that sharing 
information with enron and vice-versa would help all of us understand how 
each side may be able to position ourselves with the midwest iso mutual 
help and cooperation is to our partners esca 's and it would seem enron 's 
advantage

i got a voicemail fro ken he would be happy to meet with freeman he is 
willing to work on other times but suggested the following 
after 3 00 on may 2nd right after ken 's speech to the rga or late the day 
before or in the morning of the second to do this though he would have to 
cancel his speech to the texas governor 's business council but he is willing 
to do this if necessary 
his least preferred alternative in this general time frame would be early 
morning on the third 
jeff could you coordinate with rosie to get the time and place nailed down 
i 'll give 150 
sent by sherri sera 
i know how incredibly busy you all are so i 'm sure that making a pledge to 
jeff for the ms150 has simply slipped your mind well the ride is this 
weekend time is running out and we need you 
enron 's goal is to raise 700,000 and jeff 's personal goal is to raise 
50,000 as of today we are a little better than half way there won 't you 
consider helping him reach his goal 
thanks for your consideration i look forward to hearing from you tomorrow

jeffrey keeler enron 
19 04 2001 22 00 
attached is a first draft of a response to greenpeace 's april 5 letter to 
jeff skilling asking for enron 's answers to some specific questions on the 
kyoto protocol and climate change similar letters were delivered by 
greenpeace europe in native languages to enron 's offices in the uk 
netherlands spain and belgium 
i have attached a copy of one of the letters below all the questions are 
the same in each 
i have drafted a response with the goals of 
1 being responsive to greenpeace without being defensive or without 
greenwashing we have an already-published public statement on climate 
change and a very positive solution-oriented story to tell with many facts 
and accomplishments to back up our statements i think our letter can land 
in the stack that they consider positive responses and not in the stack of 
non-responses or we don 't care responses 
2 steering away from directly answering the no-win questions about kyoto 
i think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful 
answers to the general themes of the letter i have discussed this with 
many of you already but i strongly feel that we should not get dragged down 
into debates over what we like dislike support oppose about kyoto we 'll 
quickly get into questions we can 't now answer and may never be able to 
answer i 'd prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look 
solution-oriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be 
engaged in this important issue 
3 developing corporate-wide messages that we can use in multiple 
applications arming our pr and govt. affairs advocates with a tight script 
to use in their efforts responding to shareholder inquiries and annual 
meeting q a ken lay or other executive speeches and presentations 
something for our corporate responsibility annual report 
sorry for the long preamble but climate change has become a very sensitive 
issue of late and our message strategy needs to be very coordinated and we 
need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can 
understand and use with that said i also believe that these messages 
should be used very carefully as the subject matter is complex and straying 
too far from the basics can be dangerous we should designate one or two 
clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the greenpeace letter by 
press or policymakers and really stick to the boundaries of what 's in our 
response letter 
there is also the issue of customizing responses from the european offices 
using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of enron good deeds 
in the local areas i am not opposed to doing so but would again 
appreciate being able to review these responses before they go please let 
me know if you have other views 
i would like to send our response by early next week maybe even monday 4 23 
if we can turn it around that fast thank you for your input and assistance 
and i look forward to your reply

adding to the risk of summertime blackouts the state water department said 
20 
thursday it might not pay ridiculous prices for electricity even if that 
20 
leaves california short of power 20 
the department of water resources which has been buying electricity for th 
e 20 
state 's two beleaguered utilities since mid-january wouldn 't spell out wha 
t 20 
it considers ridiculous but if prices get too high the state might be 20 
better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation 20 
programs designed at cutting usage on short notice said raymond hart the 
20 
department 's deputy director in charge of power purchases 20 
gov. gray davis took a different view saying we will continue to keep th 
e 20 
lights on when you 're fighting a forest fire you don 't say let me see 
20 
how much is this going to cost me maybe i can 't write the check maybe i 
20 
can 't put the fire out you put the fire out and then worry about the cost 
20 
later 20 
but davis spokesman steve maviglio said the governor 's office indeed is 
20 
contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost at what point do 
es 20 
the state say enough is enough those scenarios are certainly under 20 
discussion maviglio said 20 
the water department until recently resisted buying all the power southern 
20 
california edison and pacific gas and electric co. needed refusing to 20 
purchase electricity it deemed too costly but lately it 's had to relax tha 
t 20 
stance because of an order by the federal energy regulatory commission har 
t 20 
said 20 
that april 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell 20 
electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the independent system 20 
operator which manages the state 's power grid because the iso which ge 
ts 20 
its money from the utilities can no longer buy the power the water 20 
department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities har 
t 20 
said but he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand 
20 
if the prices just get ridiculous altogether there 's a policy call to be 
20 
made and we 'll cross that bridge when we get there hart said 20 
the iso has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling 
20 
blackouts this summer the potential refusal of the water department to buy 
20 
ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid 20 
on a daily basis we 're dealt a set of cards said iso spokesman patrick 
20 
dorinson it sounds like we 're going to be handed another set of cards 
20 
and we 're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as 
20 
best we can 20 
hart 's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between davis an 
d 20 
pg e over the water department 's power expenditures state spending shot up 
20 
following pg e 's april 6 filing for bankruptcy protection 20 
davis said generators began demanding a credit penalty from the water 20 
department because of the pg e bankruptcy proceedings as a result the 20 
state 's daily costs shot up last week to 73.2 million from 57.4 million i 
n 20 
the week before pg e went bankrupt the governor 's office said 20 
hart agreed saying several generators raised their prices every time 20 
there 's a major hiccup in the market such as pg e bankruptcy or a staged 
20 
alert by the iso there 's a price run-up hart said 20 
but prices have settled down this week after peaking at 345 a megawatt ho 
ur 20 
april 12 prices for north state power were at 243 on thursday just below 
20 
what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing according to the enerfax new 
s 20 
service 20 
pg e however said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state 
s 20 
increased spending 20 
this claim is simply not accurate the utility said in a memo to reporter 
s 20 
rather the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water 20 
department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the ferc orde 
r 20 
pg e said 20 
regardless of the cause the increased spending by the water department cou 
ld 20 
further strain the state 's budget and complicate davis plan to finance 
20 
the power purchases through a bond offering 20 
the state has committed 5.2 billion from its general fund for power 20 
purchases since january those mounting purchases along with pg e 's 20 
bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties prompted a third 
20 
wall street credit rating agency fitch to place the state on a ratings 
20 
watch this week meaning the rating might be downgraded 20 
a downgrade could raise california 's borrowing costs all three of the 20 
leading wall street credit agencies now have california on a ratings watch 
20 
meanwhile the state public utilities commission on thursday ordered an 20 
investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy 
20 
providers haven 't resumed production even though they 've begun receiving 20 
payments again from edison and pg e. 20 
these generators under contract to the utilities provide more than 20 20 
percent of the state 's energy supply hundreds shut down worsening 20 
california 's power situation because they 'd received little or no money fr

the puc ordered edison and pg e to resume payments starting this week for

new power deliveries 20 
but the generators say the payments aren 't enough to get them back online

escondido calls a halt to power plant ideas 20 
temporary step will give it time for overall planning

april 19 2001 20 
escondido after being inundated with proposals to build power plants in 
20 
the past few months the city council yesterday called a timeout 20 
the council voted 3-2 to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any 20 
proposals to build energy generating facilities in the city during that 20 
period city staff members will develop a comprehensive approval process th 
at 20 
will factor in the cumulative effects of such plants 20 
we need to step back and look at the direction we 're going in city 20 
councilwoman june rady said 20 
the city has been juggling four power-plant proposals since january 20 
sempra energy resources wants to build a 500-megawatt plant in the southwe

calpeak llc of san diego has filed plans to build a 49.5-megawatt plant on 
20 
enterprise street not far from the ramco plant 20 
another firm has expressed interest in building a 49.5-megawatt plant on 
20 
city property on west washington avenue but has not submitted plans yet 
20 
yesterday 's decision means that all the projects except the 20 
already-approved ramco plant are now on hold and no new proposals can b

davis 20 
mayor lori holt pfeiler and councilwoman marie waldron opposed the move th 
ey 20 
said it would only delay much-needed solutions to the region 's energy crisi 
s 20 
which is expected to come to a head this summer 20 
if plant developers have a chance of getting power on line by the summer 
20 
we should not be the ones to stand in the way pfeiler said 20 
waldron argued that cities have to be more proactive at this time not less 
20 
the governor is not solving the problem waldron said it 's up to local 
20 
governments to try to do what they can 20 
joe rowley sempra 's project development director said he doubted the 20 
council 's decision would upset his plans 20 
our timetable is still not fully defined rowley said obviously there 's 
a 20 
lot of work we have to do to get to the point where an application can be 
20 
processed 20 
meanwhile council members listened to two people who made impassioned plea 
s 20 
for the city to consider alternative power sources 20 
david drake a service architect for saic in la jolla urged the council to 
20 
think about solar power there is more than enough available land and 20 
rooftop space to install enough solar panels to power the whole city he 
20 
said 20 
escondido has 65 square miles he said but 2,500 acres could be employe 
d 20 
to power us forever without any reliance on imported energy 20 
local inventor arnold lund urged the council to consider energy generated 
20 
from windmills 20 
the council also voted to work with san marcos in exploring ways to seek 20 
inexpensive stable energy rates 20 
the hope is that the two cities can forge a deal with sempra for cheaper 20 
rates sempra officials have said they are willing to discuss possible rate

anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added 750 million t 
o 20 
southern california edison 's cost of electricity a consultant estimated 20 
yesterday 20 
the consultant paul carpenter of the brattle group spoke to an assembly 
20 
subcommittee investigating why california pays the highest natural-gas pric 
es 20 
in the nation natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis 20 
because most of the state 's generating plants run on natural gas 20 
natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation but the bench mark 20 
price paid at california 's border has been double that paid at other bench 
20 
mark locations throughout the nation for months according to figures 20 
released by the assembly subcommittee on energy oversight 20 
next week carpenter plans to testify at hearings in washington d.c. on 
20 
behalf of southern california edison and the california public utilities 20 
commission which are asking federal regulators to intervene 20 
the giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart 
20 
deal between el paso natural gas and el paso merchant energy gave the siste 
r 20 
companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural ga 
s 20 
that flows into southern california from texas 20 
el paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in new 20 
mexico and texas to southern california el paso merchant energy is an 20 
unregulated sister company 20 
carpenter called the prices paid in southern california simply 20 
unprecedented in the united states he estimated that the sister companies 
20 
manipulated the market enough to add 2.60 to the price of a million britis 
h 20 
thermal units of gas 20 
in addition he said el paso merchant energy owns part of 20 smaller power 
20 
plants qualifying facilities that get paid based on the price of natural 
20 
gas in california the higher natural-gas prices increase the company 's 20 
revenues carpenter said 20 
el paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the assembly 
20 
subcommittee today but in proceedings before the federal regulators they 
20 
have denied any sweetheart deal 20 
in a report they commissioned the company blamed the higher natural-gas 20 
prices in southern california on increased demand and constraints on pipeli 
ne 20 
capacity 20 
gov. gray davis meanwhile gave his strongest endorsement yet to a 20 
windfall-profits tax on generators as a senate committee chaired by joseph 
20 
dunn d-laguna niguel began a series of hearings to probe possible price 
20 
gouging by generators 20 
i believe the legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist 
20 
that generators receive an appropriate reduction whether it 's 20 percent o 
r 20 
any other number the legislature hit upon davis said 20 
senate democrats davis said will form a special committee to help work on 
20 
his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of southern 20 
california edison for 2.76 billion in exchange for state aid in paying of 
f 20 
the utilities debt 20 
the governor said he told senate democrats a number of whom are skeptical 
of 20 
the plan that edison 's parent firm has agreed to back a 3 billion upgrade 
20 
of the neighborhood distribution system retained by edison and to return a 
20 
400 million tax refund to the utility 20 
at the natural-gas hearing yesterday state officials said that after el pa 
so 20 
merchant energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its 
20 
sister company it withheld natural gas to drive prices up 20 
marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and 
20 
undermine competition said harvey morris an attorney for the california 
20 
public utilities commission 20 
state regulators want the federal energy regulatory commission which 20 
regulates natural gas to open the market to more competitors 20 
but the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past 
on 20 
march 28 ferc ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal 
20 
the fact that el paso merchant controls a large volume of capacity does no 
t 20 
in and of itself render the el paso contracts unjust unreasonable or undu 
ly 20 
discriminatory ferc ruled 20 
in other cases involving natural gas federal regulators acknowledged that 
20 
certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior but they 20 
approved those contracts anyway 20 
lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators lack of action 
20 
it baffles me that we 've found the problem anti-competitive behavior an

market gaming but there 's no cure because federal regulators won 't take 20 
action said assemblyman juan vargas d-san diego

los angeles 01 gov. gray davis and a bipartisan group of the state 's 20 
congressional delegates agreed thursday that the federal government must ac 
t 20 
to control the wholesale price of energy 20 
for us the big issue is how we address the unjust rates said rep. mary 
20 
bono r-palm springs i believe we are up to it and will handle it as soon 
20 
as we can 20 
davis met behind closed doors with 27 congressional representatives 20 
including sen. dianne feinstein d-calif at the sheraton gateway hotel ne 
ar 20 
los angeles international airport he said after the 90-minute meeting that 
20 
the group discussed a threefold approach to the state 's power crisis 20 
the strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state including 20 
military facilities to conserve energy this summer and asking the federal 
20 
energy regulatory commission to find a way to control the wholesale price o 
f 20 
electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into california 20 
davis repeated his criticism of federal regulators for not acting sooner to 
20 
control the wholesale price of electricity and said he was hopeful the 20 
state 's congressional delegation could work together to find a bipartisan 
20 
solution 20 
we agreed there has to be a mechanism to reduce the wholesale price of 20 
electricity davis said we have agreed to work cooperatively across part 
y 20 
lines to find ways we can reduce those costs we 're in this together party 
20 
doesn 't matter finding a solution does matters 20 
to have the price of moving natural gas go up by a factor of 10 or more is 
20 
absurd said rep. brad sherman d-los angeles so many of our colleagues 
20 
are telling us it 's california 's fault but california does not have the 20 
authority to regulate these two items 20 
the group also talked about easing environmental regulations during power 
20 
emergencies to allow small companies and even military bases to run small 
20 
generators 20 
if you have generators in the state regardless of what they run on becau 
se 20 
we 're entering this emergency period in the summertime and will be short of 
20 
power you should be allowed to turn them on said rep. duncan hunter r-e

hunter said small generators could produce about 500 to 600 megawatts durin 
g 20 
a power emergency if exemptions to various clear air requirements could be 
20 
made 20 
officials discussed ways to allow ferc to control wholesale prices without 
20 
violating ideological positions staked out by high-ranking republican 20 
officials including vice president dick cheney who oppose price controls 
20 
and favor free markets 20 
rep jane harman d-torrance said she would support a finding by ferc that 
20 
power wholesalers should not be allowed to charge market rates but rather 
20 
rates more tightly pegged to the cost of generating power 20 
we 're not talking about artificial caps harman said we should insist 
20 
that the ferc not renew their market-based rate authority and if we go tha 
t 20 
route it takes us to the same place and avoids the ideological fight 20 
the meeting did not result in any specific proposals but participants prais 
ed 20 
the bipartisan nature of the talks and said it would result in a unified 20 
approach in washington 20 
we have a responsibility to make sure the federal government takes it 's ro

regulators open investigation into alternative power providers 20

april 19 2001 20 
san francisco 01 hoping to prevent california 's bleak power outlook from 
20 
becoming even darker state regulators thursday launched an investigation 
20 
into why alternative energy providers aren 't producing more electricity 20 
with the action the california public utilities commission hopes to 20 
determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the 
20 
reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides mu 
ch 20 
of the state 's energy 20 
these alternative generators 01 known in the industry as qualifying 20 
facilities or qfs 01 have been scaling back or shutting down as debts o 
wed 20 
by california 's two largest utilities pile up the qfs are owed an estimate 
d 20 
700 million by bankrupt pacific gas and electric and financially crippled 
20 
southern california edison 20 
some qfs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer much-needed 20 
maintenance leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity 
20 
output other qfs say they simply can 't afford to keep operating 20 
the puc is worried some qfs are trying to take advantage of the california 
20 
crisis to get out of long-term contracts that require them to sell 20 
electricity at prices far below the current market rate several qfs are 20 
suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market 
20 
said puc commissioner carl wood 20 
all the qfs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as november 
20 
said jack raudy a spokesman for the renewable energy creditors committee 
20 
which consists of 10 alternative power producers owed a combined 410 20 
million those 10 generators produce about 3,000 megawatts 01 which raudy 
said 20 
was enough electricity for 3 million homes 20 
we are outraged by the puc 's investigation raudy said we have heard 
so 20 
much rhetoric over the past five months and still haven 't been paid a dime 
20 
that is what we are worried about 20 
raudy estimated his group is operating at about 95 percent of capacity 20 
after the temporary closure of several qfs contributed to rolling blackouts 
20 
around the state last month the puc ordered pg e and socal edison to begin 
20 
paying the generators for the energy purchased since march 27 20 
but the order has done nothing to help the qfs recover the past debts the 
20 
qfs are now in line in bankruptcy court with 30,000 creditors owed money by 
20 
pg e which expects its unpaid bills to rise to 5.5 billion by the end of 
20 
this month 20 
if the qfs get desperate enough they may decide to push socal edison into 
an 20 
involuntary bankruptcy case raudy said 20 
puc commissioner geoffrey brown defended the alternative energy providers 
20 
during thursday 's hearing 20 
any qfs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reason 
s 20 
not to game the system he said 20 
california will need all the power that it can get from the qfs this summer 
20 
when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence 20 
combined the qfs account for about one-fourth of california 's total power 
20 
capacity according to the puc 20 
the qf output will become even more essential this summer because californi 
a 20 
won 't be able to import as much electricity from the pacific northwest as i 
t 20 
has in the past a lack of rain has left the pacific northwest 's 20 
hydroelectric supply at its second-lowest level ever and it could diminish 
20 
to a record low if the recent drought continues 20 
we are not going to be able to look to the pacific northwest to meet our 
20 
needs wood said after reviewing a new report on the hydroelectricity 20 
supply 20 
the looming blackouts and electricity price increases caused by california 
s 20 
energy crisis is exasperating businesses and households across the state 
20 
fearing the frustration could boil over into terrorism the puc thursday 20 
installed metal detectors to screen everyone attending the agency 's public

this may be the surest sign yet of the depth of california 's energy 20 
crisis a bipartisan cross-section of the state 's congressional delegation 
20 
brought together thursday by gov. gray davis not only agreed about the 20 
severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal 20 
intervention 20 
this meeting did not have the word democrat or republican used 20 
once rep. darrell e. issa r-vista said of the unusual spirit of 20 
cooperation at the meeting near los angeles international airport 
members of both parties said the federal energy regulatory commission 
20 
must slash wholesale electricity prices so california utilities can once 20 
again afford to buy power since january the state government has been 20 
buying electricity on their behalf as skyrocketing wholesale prices put 20 
pacific gas electric co. and southern california edison billions of dolla 
rs 20 
into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them pg e has since 
20 
filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
although the bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strong 
ly 20 
opposed to price caps and ferc has refused to grant them california 20 
republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the 20 
administration will agree to some other form of price regulation they 20 
brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their 20 
ideological belief in a free market 
this is not a free-enterprise situation rep. duncan hunter r-alpin 
e 20 
said after the meeting in fact it 's just the opposite 
specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices 20 
charged to california and those charged in other western states he said 20 
california clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs 
20 
under federal law the ferc must regulate the prices of companies if it fin 
ds 20 
they are exerting market power to drive prices to unreasonable levels 
executives from two texas energy companies meeting with legislators i 
n 20 
sacramento denied thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in 20 
california to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical 20 
pipeline into the state 
after the extraordinary meeting in los los angeles rep. brad sherman 
20 
d-sherman oaks said the biggest disagreement between california democrats 
20 
and republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in th 
e 20 
ability of president bush and his administration to help california there 
20 
has been much speculation that bush who lost california in november has n 
o 20 
political motive to help the state 
we democrats said sherman hope very much that our skepticism is 
20 
proven wrong 
davis--who sat flanked by democratic u.s. sen. dianne feinstein and th 
e 20 
governor 's newly appointed chief energy advisor s. david freeman--said he 
20 
used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by 20 
californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch i 
n 20 
five republicans and more than a dozen democrats attended the gathering 
feinstein said thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet wi 
th 20 
bush to discuss the energy situation meeting with times reporters and 20 
editors wednesday she described a recent meeting with vice president dick 
20 
cheney in which she said he ignored her appeal for federal assistance 
20 
feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies sayi 
ng 20 
they appear to have constricted access to a california-bound pipeline to ru 
n 20 
up prices 
the brattle group a respected consulting firm alleged wednesday befo 
re 20 
an assembly committee that dynegy inc. and el paso natural gas co. had 20 
manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline 
20 
capacity that they had in effect withheld access to it 
that action the experts said directly forced companies trying to 20 
deliver gas to california to look for alternatives clogging other pipeline 
s 20 
and causing a surge in prices 
the explanation el paso executives said was simple demand for gas 
20 
soared in california because generators that use gas to make electricity 20 
increased production last year in response to the energy crisis 
we 're not withholding capacity--no one is said el paso merchant 20 
energy president ralph eads with these prices you want to sell every 20 
molecule 
in other developments thursday 
the agreement between davis and edison international to return its 
20 
ailing utility arm to financial health is in deep trouble and could be 20 
rejected by legislators the standard poor 's credit rating agency said i 
n 20 
a note to clients citing legislative and other sources a rejection of the 
20 
deal would be a humiliating setback for the governor s p said 
the agreement calls for among other things the sale of edison 's 20 
transmission grid to the state for 2.76 billion and the sale of 2 billion 
20 
in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility 's huge electricity debt 20 
edison agreed to several constraints including the sale of electricity to 
20 
the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power 
since they returned monday from a two-week recess state legislators 
20 
have been sharply critical of the edison agreement and have indicated a 20 
desire to tinker with aspects of the deal some lawmakers have said publicl 
y 20 
that a bankruptcy protection filing by edison like that of pg e might not 
20 
be such a dire outcome 
but a senior edison executive said it is way too early to give up on 
20 
passage of the proposal which legislators have not yet seen in official fo 
rm 
there is an education process to do here the executive said of the 
20 
highly detailed 38-page document the legislators should be asking 20 
questions that is appropriate 
the public utilities commission voted to investigate whether 20 
alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding 
20 
supplies from pg e and edison which owe them hundreds of millions of dolla 
rs 
the action commissioner carl w. wood said was prompted in part by 20 
lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts wit 
h 20 
the cash-starved utilities the producers of solar wind and geothermal 20 
energy account for more than 25 of california 's electricity supply 
the question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long 
20 
hot days of summer wood said 
jack raudy of the renewable energy creditors committee said the puc 20 
needs to address the 700 million the producers are owed all we have gott 
en 20 
is rhetoric from the governor the puc and the utilities he said 
an 850-million plan to entice californians to conserve precious 20 
megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks compounding predictions by 
20 
state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in may and june 
davis signed the conservation spending package last week earmarking 
20 
242 million of the new funds for the public utilities commission to 20 
distribute to the state 's investor-owned utilities to support existing 20 
conservation programs 
but barbara hale director of the puc 's division of strategic planning 
20 
said thursday that since pacific gas electric co. filed for bankruptcy 20 
protection april 6 the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds 
hale testifying before a state senate committee said pg e 's 20 
decision--coupled with the threat that southern california edison could 20 
follow a similar route to u.s. bankruptcy court--has complicated her agency 
s 20 
efforts 
pg e spokeswoman staci homrig said her company plans to petition the 
20 
bankruptcy court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and 
20 
separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings she said if th 
e 20 
court denies the request pg e would ask to be permitted to pay the expense 
s 20 
anyway the process she added could take about a month--too long in the 
20 
view of some legislators given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for la 
te 20 
spring and early summer 
deputy director bob therkelsen of the california energy commission sai 
d 20 
his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolste 
r 20 
their output during that period but he said some producers did not purchas 
e 20 
the necessary equipment because pg e and edison have failed to pay them in 
20 
full for earlier electricity deliveries 
it 's not a huge amount he said of the anticipated production 20 
shortfall but every little bit helps

a san francisco ice cream parlor a karate studio and a costume shop are al 
l 20 
in the same boat and that goes for a divisadero street psychiatrist too 
20 
they 're all in the fortunate position of having money coming to them 20 
and they 're all in the tough spot of having that money owed by the sort-of 
20 
bankrupt pacific gas and electric co 20 
many of the 47,894 creditors that pg e owes money to according to a list 
20 
filed with the bankruptcy judge are banks power companies lawyers and th 
e 20 
like 20 
but a surprising number are businesses that at first blush might seem 20 
unlikely to be power company creditors many businesses like the act 20 
costume rental shop didn 't know or had forgotten that pg e had run up a 
20 
tab 20 
and since the list didn 't say how much they 're owed businesses had to gues 
s 20 
how about that said costume shop manager callie floor when told she had 
20 
pg e money coming to her 20 
floor checking her books said it looks like pg e forgot to pay its 100 
20 
bill to cover a costume rental for a corporate dress-up party in 1992 20 
we rent a lot of costumes for corporate events she said that 's probabl 
y 20 
what it was 20 
psychiatrist richard lieberman says he does not know why or how much pg e 
20 
owes him 20 
but i 'll take it he said pg e has taken advantage of the consumer for 
so 20 
long as far as i 'm concerned pg e can go under and stay under 20 
of course pg e may wind up paying pennies on the dollar if anything 20 
because that 's how bankruptcies work the notion is depressing which 20 
psychiatrists are used to 20 
karate studio gets hit 
karate master scott morton whose karate one studio on van ness avenue is 
20 
also a creditor said karate is all about fairness and integrity which pg 
e 20 
seems to be even shorter on than cash 20 
i think the bankruptcy stinks morton said all the money is going aroun 
d 20 
and around it 's all the same company 20 
the karate studio conducted a self-defense class for about a dozen workers 
at 20 
pg e headquarters morton a black belt who does not take treachery lightly 
20 
said he was pretty sure the check cleared but maybe not 20 
no big deal for some 
at beauchamp 's welding and repair in petaluma owner dean beauchamp wasn 't 
20 
concerned 20 
they don 't owe us enough to worry about he said less than 100 i 'd 20 
guess 20 
beauchamp 's shop does small jobs for the big utility they 've been really 
20 
good about sending us a check once in a great while something will get 20 
misplaced and i guess that 's how our name got on the list 20 
yolanda fletcher the owner of red shoes slide service says the utility 20 
probably owes her about 100 for preparing some photographs for a corporate 
20 
slide show 20 
larry mitchell proprietor of the award-winning mitchell 's ice cream shop o 
n 20 
san jose avenue believes that pg e may owe him 500 for a corporate ice 20 
cream social 20 
that would cover the ice cream the toppings the dishes and the spoons 
he 20 
said 20 
the utility 's rocky road may be metaphorical but an ice cream store 's rock 
y 20 
road is the real thing he said and being owed 500 by a bankrupt company 
is 20 
not peaches and cream 20 
unexpected names 
the list of creditors also includes such strange bedfellows as the san 20 
francisco fire department the yosemite fund the chronicle and pg e 's own 
20 
library petty cash fund perhaps the strangest bedfellow of all is the 20 
perpetual pg e foe known as turn or the utility reform network which stan 
ds 20 
to lose thousands of dollars in state-mandated legal fees from pg e for its 
20 
work as an intervener or utility watchdog 20 
among the utility 's more sensible business partners is the beale street 20 
sandwich shop a few steps from the main entrance to pg e 's headquarters 20 
building in san francisco 20 
unlike the big banks and power companies that are on the hook for millions

sh 20 
every month from chen 20 
that 's the way we 've always done it payment right away he said that w
